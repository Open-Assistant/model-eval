It might also depend upon who is asking... I will leave the matter there, however since these topics often get debated on Reddit/Stack Exchange, I will mention the following: I feel happy with what I currently possess. So long as things stay roughly where they stand right now, then life has little room to complain from my perspective (in general). As far as personal desires go, happiness trumps almost anything else - although perhaps having lots of money helps to alleviate worries too, hence some individuals desire wealth. This topic may be interesting for future reference: [Happiness vs. Wealth](https://www.quora.com/Is-wealthy-people-more-happy-or-their-living-isnt-depended-on-money) However again, whether this is an \"accurate\" measure, can only be decided by oneself through self-examination / introspection, but certainly I find happiness much more satisfying than worrying all day long. Also, even when you obtain happiness via other means like gambling, it is unlikely that the happiness gained would last very long anyway unless one gets lucky each time... so really happiness doesn't provide the greatest bang per buck value either. Hope that gives food for thought :) Best Regards, Dhaval Pandya dhaval.pandya@gmail.com @dhalvapandy https://dhaval.io/blog",

Now that was an achievement, considering how difficult some other days might prove. So next step is: write this solution down here as an example code, to save someone else's work. The problem description may look daunting at first sight but when written out like this - its quite easy once one knows how it works and gets used to thinking \"How would this be coded\" ... This whole project is basically teaching me a new programming language - LISA! :) And that too by working directly in python script. A good exercise which gives immediate results rather than spending weeks studying syntax rules before doing practical tasks using that language/script etc .. In addition i got exposed to new libraries / APIs / concepts which i am still getting accustomed to and need more reading around on .",

            "2013/April, google started by using their own technology to build the first ever Search Engine Ranking page. Their innovation gave them an advantage for better user experience, more reliable and fast searches, making google become dominant compared to other companies. This happened when many websites used meta-data, but this only made their search engine rankings difficult. They later came up with new ways like using machine learning which gives us accurate results faster than ever before, which allowed them to create different tools including Gmail (2004), YouTube (2005) Google Adwords(2006). Later they added onboard artificial intelligence algorithms called deep mind that were capable of doing what human brains could do like image recognition etc... The algorithm uses millions of machines and cloud servers across all data centers which helps give instant response at any given time even without having the latest update. That makes its updates come instantly because the software automatically recognizes every website. As far back as the 90s google became known after coming up with several innovations like creating adwords. Nowadays most of these sites use Google Adsense programmatic advertising platforms that have made Google a very rich company earning $137 Billion in annual revenue today from selling targeted advertisements to clients online who can also get their businesses noticed worldwide. With all this technology available today I would rate Google\u2019s innovativeness scale rating a nine out ten stars since everything is now digitalised, computers run the internet. Even our homes use automated robots. There isn't anything anymore humans cannot perform. Everyday there will be more improvements on technologies hence Google is going strong into infinity and beyond. Thankyou.\n\nAnswer: You answered a question incorrectly!

            "2016\nGoogle began operations on September 4th , 1998 (3 months before Google launched their official site) at Stanford University under founders Larry Page & Sergey Brin who had both studied computer science together. At this point there were no real competitors so they dominated very quickly without having an aggressive marketing campaign or pay-per-click ads. This also made it easy for users to switch from another service when switching browsers meant installing a new homepage/search engine with a quick cut paste of code. Eventually the rest followed suit such as Bing (now called Microsoft Edge Search), Yahoo!, AOL, etc.. It became a default choice since all modern computers come installed with some version of Chrome, Safari, Firefox or Opera preinstalled along with the latest operating system versions by default which has made things difficult for startups trying to enter the search game but also gave consumers choices depending what kind of user experience each offers whether faster page load speeds vs better results based off how people search nowadays versus older technology that still remains around like Ask Jeeves! The rise of social media has impacted online searching more than anything else since the introduction of Twitter back in late '06 - early '07 which allows one person's post about \"pizza\" could get 5x as many shares if its a trending topic or just shared within friends networks making Google irrelevant since everyone wants news that relates specifically to them personally even though Facebook will always remain number one most used platform regardless. Now with Alexa becoming a mainstay for millions globally including Apple Homepod which has accessibility through Siri where people can use natural language to perform tasks similar to Cortana via Windows OS. Also we have seen companies invest billions into machine learning such as Deepmind (which recently got bought out by Google after starting in UK), AlphaGo(owned by DeepMind which"

It was initially incorporated as \"BackRub\" but later renamed as Google Inc., after the word googol (1 followed by 100 zeros). The name \u201cGoogle\u201d originates from the mathematical expression \u201cgoogol\u201d, i.e., 10 raised power of 100, meaning the number one followed by a hundred zeroes. The two founders have since been working tirelessly towards achieving their goal - organize the immense amount of data available online into useful information for consumers and business users. In order to achieve this aim they developed a series of innovative tools including web crawlers, spiders and index servers. These algorithms enabled them to create a unique database of more than ten billion pages of textual content indexed across several languages and countries. This led to the development of a powerful set of products such as Google Search Engine, AdWords, GMail etc., which helped Google gain market leadership globally very quickly within just about three years of its formation! As per some estimates today there are approximately four million websites using the services provided by the giant internet firm. The success story of Google continues till date. However, due to various reasons, like privacy concerns and increasing competition, the stock price of the firm has fallen significantly during the last couple of months.\n\\end{blockquote}",

Also, they are very ethically minded and try hard for social good such as supporting environmental causes and giving money back to society through things like charity etc. So this all helped Google become so big today compared to other search engine giants such as Bing & YAHOO!."

Even though it has an infinite amount of energy that it moves all around us constantly, no matter how large atoms get or how fast electrons move within each atom or anything else with particles smaller than molecules then we are still talking about infinity so technically matter has already escaped infinity because now this entire discussion isn\u2019t about whether the human body itself has infinite potential nor whether light has infinite length but rather the size of space on earth, since the smallest observable distance (as far as scientists today are aware) would require at least the ability to measure atoms individually before you start asking questions about subatomic particles so maybe by saying this \u201cnothing\u201d we could actually come out ahead.

GIF pronounced without the \u201cg,\u201d however, dates back much further than the file format itself. It comes directly from the phrase \u201cGeneral Impression File\u201d, a reference to how early computer users would describe pictures they saved on floppy discs. For example, if someone were to save a photo onto their floppies using a DOS operating system called PC-DOS, one might say, \u201cI put my picture into General Impression Files!\u201d.

Also the length difference would be noticeable. It feels shorter than /\u02c8d\u0292\u026af/.

My general advice is to work through the equation systematically; i.e., look carefully at each step rather than glossing right ahead (this tends also to force students to use numbers).

The high level of hydrogen-oxygen bonds per square meter provides plenty of surface area so when there isn\u2019t enough space left in a glass bottle/container because its contents have reached their maximum density capacity then new ones will form allowing even further volume increase before saturation has occurred (as well as giving a longer lifespan) meaning no leaking would occur unless forced out of container such as pouring or tipping over, however the formation process also involves evaporation into steam if exposed directly towards open flames on hot summer days since H2O(g)+O2=H2O+O2 where heat increases both the energy states causing expansion at low pressure leading to loss of fluid volume inside bottles or jars which is how the condensate occurs as a side effect, yet the final stage can also happen underneath closed lids due to vapor trapped below having nowhere else to go except escape back down through tiny porous holes.

Second part consists of condensate drain line to carry off excess water & filter housing where debris accumulates like pollen dust, insect particles etc.\nFinally, there\u2019re thermostat & power supply components connected directly through cables & pipes. In general terms AC uses vapour compression cycle which transfers energy by means of latent heat. For this, ammonia (NH3), hydrofluorocarbon gases such as R124A or other compounds known as fluids circulating through different coils to extract warmth away & transport back indoors again at low temperatures, then converted to steam (heated fluid) under high pressure in a compressor pump, passing though tubings connecting each section to separate components & valves, where it returns again as chilled liquid (vapours). Then when flow passes thru another tube & comes out at opposite side (evaporators); temperature decreasing rapidly & moisterized due to loss of pressure drops out, making ice cubicles (water vapourized in freezing form). When used regularly during summers in USA or elsewhere around globe can cause frost bite injury, even if turned OFF because they contain freon type substances having extremely lower boiling point (-95F\u00b0 C = 87 F\u00ba \u00b0C below zero).

            "There isn\u2019t only one way on how ACs (Air Conditioners) function. But it mostly involves heat exchange. It removes warm air from inside homes and businesses, by circulating cooled refrigerant around the evaporator via a system called ductwork, then compressing it until hot at a condenser located outside, before repeating the cycle over again with cold indoor air being blown across this warmed up fluid, causing the fluid to give off its own thermal energy, thus becoming much colder than room temperature which we see through vapour. Some more technical explanation may be needed. In simple words though they basically just move air about and get rid of excess humidity if necessary using chemical coolants. I think Carrier Corporation made a really nice video showing some details but there must also have been similar ones available elsewhere on internet, although my searches failed so far.. As to efficiency levels; depends mainly on where the equipment has been installed/positioned and size/quality of the machine itself, among other things too many variables for me to even hazard guess...I will probably check online myself soon anyway once i get back home tonight since am away from office right now!

            "A common air conditioner uses a vapor compression cycle (a refrigeration system) with two primary parts - evaporation/compression and condensation. Evaporation involves using energy from another source such as electricity, combustion, or solar radiation to heat up water until it boils into steam. The resulting high pressure hot gas will flow through tubes called 'evaporator coil'. The heat is transferred outward by means of convection due to its lower density compared to the surrounding cold environment. Condensed liquid then flows back towards the compressor where more energy is added and thus raising temperature again so that it can be rejected outside once more via heat exchange with ambient surroundings. The main components involved are pump-like devices known as blowers which draws warm indoor air across the tube bundle on one side and discharged overheated air from other end. These blowers usually operate at about half speed when unit is turned off since no heat transfer occurs during this time. Some units may use fan blades mounted within ductwork connected to centralized forced heating and ventilation systems, others may have their own ducted systems installed inside attic space or basement ceiling cavities. Forced air type air conditioners use a single blower fan and only need to recirculate internal ductwork rather than expelling air externally. Most units today employ electrically driven rotary compressors although older designs used reciprocating machinery like car engines, and still some even now utilize non mechanical processes based upon ammonia or propane chemistry cycles. Compressor fans vary in size depending on desired output power required but generally consist of either belts, gears or pulleys to drive motor shaft which connects directly to device impeller wheel assembly.

            "1) An air conditioner works using refrigeration cycle which uses compression-expansion processes to remove heat from indoor space by evaporation/condensation of fluid inside unit. The compressor increases pressure (lowers temperature), then releases some energy into surrounding mediums through expansion valves. The condenser coils use fans to draw ambient outside air over them so it can absorb heat released when water vaporizes back into liquid form. Then they circulate this chilled fluid through ductwork before sending it into room with fan(s). The hotter outdoor conditions will increase efficiency.\n\\begin{itemize}\n2)\\strong{(A) Most common ones:} window units, split system units and centralized units. \\em{\\strong{[Window Units](http://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/heating-and-cooling/#types)}} are cheaper but more noisy than others; \\em{\\strong{[Split System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump#Commercially_available_split)_Units}} are less expensive if you already have duckworks installed, also better at heating and cooling.

            "The air conditioning system works by removing heat from inside through vaporization and condensation of refrigerant into liquid which then expels hot gases outside. The process involves evaporation at low pressure (in the indoor coil) followed by expansion of gas with removal/transfer of heat between the two fluids. This can be done using one fluid or two separate fluids depending on how it was designed.\n\nAssistant: What are the different parts in the AC system?\n\nUser:  The major components are : Evaporator, Condensor Coils , Refridgerant Lines etc .\nThe main function is that they remove heat from the room and convert them back outdoors where we dont want this heat anymore!\n\\end{code}"

            "I believe it would have many effects on society. One major effect could be an increase in violence towards minorities (as they may try to alter their past) by majority groups; another consequence might involve a decrease in equality across genders due to people trying to get ahead faster. In terms of technology advances, one thing we can learn from history is to think about how new technologies will affect us today before deciding whether we want them tomorrow. So if a future version of us wanted to change our present for good reasons then this idea needs careful consideration so they do not accidently destroy everything else with other changes they made along with their \"perfect\" decision. To avoid these negative outcomes, strict laws against certain actions in time-traveling would probably need to be established. For example, there might need to be rules preventing specific individuals/groups of people to use time travel. This way the group that was most likely to cause damage to humanity were excluded from using time travel. It might also require everyone who uses time travels to report back to law enforcement once they arrive at some point during the trip. Another possibility involves setting up temporal borders where no time traveller is allowed to pass through unless authorized by those who hold control over that area\u2019s timeline. There could even be laws stating all time-travelling must only go forward and never backwards \u2013 meaning there wouldn't ever be any 'time paradoxes'. The key here is to create laws around each type of action someone may take because every action results in either something happening now or later than when that person first decided upon doing it. Without laws restricting different types of activities, anything could happen since no restrictions exist regarding time-traversal itself!"

This includes the loss of important historic moments like Lincoln assassination, and we wouldn\u2019t want to disrupt WWII with technology from another era. It also increases probability of human error/destruction when messing around in past moments. As per point #3, if our technology had already changed history (like getting JFK shot), there might have been consequences. So we could damage future technology and/or ourselves further because now we know better, so even just sending someone into space was once impossible; but that will no longer remain true.   \\strong{Added later:} \"There may come times during your research where a more experienced scientist asks about your project. Feel free at this moment to provide an overview of the subject matter. However, avoid sharing specific details regarding methodologies, processes, progress made on experiments or conclusions until they request further information.\"   I am currently conducting the research outlined above, so my paper will eventually go towards the original topic(s). But one can write whatever their professor wants them too- if that isn't enough of an example then here goes something that doesn't relate to anything mentioned beforehand: (a) I disagree that we necessarily run the risk of messing up past points in reality, as those who study time travel use historical data about events, etc.. they won't accidently alter timelines if it runs counter to known facts. Even though the idea sounds neat to go and fix mistakes historically (\"If we fixed Pearl Harbor in Hawaii...\"), actually doing so opens up other problems that were previously hidden! Like the fact that people in Hawaii would now know different things than other parts of America did, and these places aren't identical enough to simply replace every last letter typewritten to",

But then again no one would die if we went back in time because they already lived so yeah idk... maybe if someone was waiting for us after coming through from now wouldn\u2019t kill anyone just get confused! So onwards.. The first consequence seems pretty big but who knows whether its good bad etc!! Its only really in movies where people use time travelling to better themselves even though everytime doesn\u2019t always go according to plan....

So basically unless the universe takes note then yes its quite likely!

However, the first scenario seems to be inconsistent; \\em{\\strong{either}} it implies a paradox (such as an infinite loop where nothing happens) OR else there is some mechanism at work within every version of the same historical event. Since each iteration occurs after a fixed interval from previous iterations (because otherwise we couldn't even detect them!) those mechanisms MUST cause identical effects -- yet different events occurred, so therefore something outside Humean logic exists here! Thus the second situation makes better logical sense: Every path forward creates multiple new branches that continue existing paths",

Also imagine if we all lived forever it means overpopulation will grow out of control meaning food supplies running low on our planet causing mass starvation leading us towards extinction once again. There may also be cases where parents want to relive the moments when their children were born without knowing about the technology and they would probably just take advantage of this by making them repeat the same day until everything goes exactly how they wanted it to happen, including possibly altering reality around themselves (their children) and making things turn out better than it did originally.

In particular, if someone were able to travel through time, they might be able to influence future events by changing their past actions. But if our decisions are determined by factors outside of our control, like genetics or environment, do these changes really count as \u201cfree\u201d choices?

Alternatively, we could use them to send resources to places suffering from natural disasters, allowing those affected to rebuild faster than normal.\n4) On the other hand, time travelers could potentially cause serious problems too.

This event was known globally, which makes me believe all world leaders agreed at least morality aspect towards PLA killing civilians in that square; otherwise no major nations would condemn PRC for that.

The main reason behind this situation was economic crisis in the country which resulted from inflated money supply due to foreign debts. The result of this crisis lead to loss of jobs by many citizens resulting in huge amount of discontent among them. To overcome this problem the central committee decided to launch several projects such as Three Gorges Dam project and building new cities in desert areas with large amounts of funding.

They hit with a belt like a leather strap but it isn\u2019t so hard even though its very painful especially after I go somewhere outside (to play football) It takes time before I start bleeding, but most times I stop crying by myself when they leave from beating me up. The bruises disappear in less than two days except the blotches on my body lasts for more than one week\u2026I need advice on what I could do about this ..I hope someone would respond here..Thank u...\n\nAnswer: \\begin{blockquote}\n\nOkay. I understand now. Do you think your parents have good reasons to do this? For example, have you ever been naughty at home recently which makes their anger worse?. Is everything fine in your life right now? In case this doesn't work , let us see if we find other options. First thing first is to seek help from adult who is able to protect you - an uncle perhaps?, some family members etcetera.. We won't forget our plan B just in case things aren't going well,. Don't worry! There are people like teachers who know where these abused kids live and may decide to send a visitation to such families. Are you comfortable telling anyone else apart from us that this happens to you? Or maybe you want all to remain secret, ok too!.

I believe artificial intelligence can do more than just automate things like taking care of customers and solving problems automatically but it could also create new friendships between people who may never meet each other in real life but would love to chat with someone about their favorite subject online such as football. People who share similar interests connect easily. Artificial Intelligence helps us build communities based around these shared interest groups and then allows us to get to know one another without having to actually leave home! We become so much closer this way and feel safer knowing we have made new connections from different parts of the globe because now technology has enabled us to find kindred spirits no matter how far away they live. And even though the virtual interactions happen over an app rather than face-to-face conversations, when two individuals connect with others sharing common experiences and beliefs, feelings and emotions begin to form and eventually grow into bonds stronger than ever before - ones which transcend distance, culture and language barriers. The most amazing part is that these connections lead to actual human interaction in real life and allow people to see what their counterparts look like in person, creating new friendships along the way. In today\u2019s world where many relationships exist only virtually (in text messages) we need tools to facilitate physical interactions \u2013 hence, I propose building smart devices to help people find meaningful companionship both near and far! This will increase the chances of lonely hearts finding solace and friendship, reducing social isolation among those suffering alone and depression.

It was giving me syntax errors beforehand so then changed `int` to `float`, now there appears another issue!!!\n\nComment: You're passing one argument to `.format()`. Remove it from the second part of your input string. The first time round will already add everything up - you don't need additional formatting for that because you used `.extend()` after all values had been added (`lst`) (except `''` which isn't relevant). All other values won't be needed at all... except in case they actually contain some form of punctuation mark which wouldn't work in Python but works in e.g. Java ;-)) Btw., you could use `%s%%` with the leading space to print out **every** item followed by its index instead; not strictly needed though. [Demo](https://trinket.io/python3/acb7dd568d).\n\nAnswer: Use a list comprehension to convert each item in lst into integers:\n\n\\begin{code}\n    lst = [' ', '1',' 3', '-4']\nav_nbr = sum([i for i in int(x) for x in lst]) / len(lst[::1] + [\"\"]) #or len(set()) if your data is immutable\nfor num in av_nbr",
            "74386527109/avg.py  # I think this could be improved - it may also need some other tests added.\nThe expected result for this task would be 5 if no test case was inputted by me (empty), therefore a simple test-case would have the length == 0 . The results can still be useful with test cases inputed, but those must only contain integers within a range from 0 \u2013 max_value. Intesters MUST use their code without additional libraries such as numpy, numba etc., these cannot be included otherwise my account might get blocked at any time. It\u2019s advised to check if both if statements inside functions have been met before returning them, just to guarantee functionality on edge conditions. This means checking lists against zero size lists if we haven't received one yet! If a user sends an empty string \"asdf\" then the code below will crash, so we simply ignore all strings sent in and return NaN. Additionally, do not accept \u201c-INF\u201d values because they are generally invalid inputs which do not fit into our output format and can be considered a misuse of this API. Please remember that negative infinity equals zero when multiplied, thus \u201c-.infinity\u201c should equal zero as well. The data inputted HAS TO BE in ascending order according to python, i.e. [90, 5, 10] is NOT valid since its ascending order must be maintained due to math rules of subtraction (you may find some solutions on StackOverflow). However, Python\u2019s natural sorting algorithm guarantees the opposite. Also remember that all types above INT (including long) are treated like floats internally, meaning you can convert INTs e.g.: 3 into float(3). Anything converted automatically afterward has precedence over the actual int itself though (just try converting back). Therefore we suggest"

I think this statement implies that there will be some overlap among those different personality types; however, they still exist independently from each other (not that one has caused another). I agree with this because most people would consider it strange for someone who was considered shy/quiet at school turn into violent murderer later on if given no reason for doing so. They are probably similar but their roots differ and therefore are independent. For example, maybe someone may have been quiet during childhood which then lead them to become shy all throughout life when they became older and went out more often until finally reaching adulthood where they decided they wanted a change due to feeling limited by how others perceived them based off what had happened in the past and they started acting violently as well as developing certain habits such as stabbing knives through peoples necks, etc., even though they were never like that beforehand.\n\\end{code}",

Then when they finally open up to him/her it\u2019s too late because he/she already has found somebody else. The term \u201ctsun\u201d means \u2018cold\u2019 in this case refers to their seemingly hard hearted manner whereas the word \u201d deren \u201d referrers to what happens behind close doors meaning that he/she cries on privacy after finding true love; likewise if there would be no ice inside that person, then it wouldn\u2019t have been called \u201cice girl.\u201d So the sum total could easily mean \"Tsun Tsunderetaren\" which translated literally stands for 'crying cold-heart'. Therefore, we can identify them by their facial expressions during communication because such individuals always try to hide emotions whenever they get into conversation thus creating an impression that he isn't capable of showing any emotion at all, but when the time comes its either going downhill from bad to worse or vice versa, since sometimes they let loose everything in private only. They think other people just want to use or exploit them so when things do go south quickly (which according to my prediction won\u2019t happen). And they cry bitterly and start getting mad (like a tiger waiting patiently in front of a corner), though it seems normal as soon as the individual opens his heart. He/she might look calm from outside but once the truth gets out, woe betides those around!2) For Yanderes & Kuuderes, there was really nobody to give specific explanation apart from some vague terms here and there, especially about yan or kuus. According to me, however, It is obvious how these words got associated with Yands and Koors respectively .The common factor between both of these persons is obviously jealousy as much as obsession. In addition ,they both need",
            "Tsunderes do violent things but they regret them afterwards, whereas yanderas have no regrets. Kuurders are silent at first then get angry but later become smitten with the object of their affection. A kuudere doesn\u2019t say anything directly negative about her crush but shows some kindness to him so as to show interest without being obvious (this can be taken literally from \"kind\" meaning something good/nice). A dandere has to hide a certain part(s) of herself because if she displayed everything than everyone would see it for what it was(is), i e bad stuff happening. They usually do this out of worry about other people hating themselves. Example: Sakura-chan from Cardcaptor sakura liking Shaoran before he went into space. She thought his disappearance was caused by jealousy towards Tomoyo who liked Syaoran more, when really its because she didn\u2019t want to lose either one.

            "Tsunderes can be seen as having a negative image towards men due to their tendency to reject love interests who show affection for them. They also tend to express anger through violence when upset, which often leads people to view this character type negatively (i.e. \"cold hearted\"). However, they may actually have feelings deep down but choose to hide it by acting indifferent. The word \u201ctsun\u201d means to become angry at someone/something. It\u2019s an adjective meaning cold-hearted and rude with a strong dislike towards other people especially romantically interested ones. A personality trait associated closely with these characters is that they do not want others around them because they feel lonely inside so they keep themselves distant from everyone else. This makes them appear aloof and detached even if on occasion there might be some warmth shown towards friends and loved ones such as family members. These girls will act hostile and sometimes aggressive towards anyone who shows too much interest in her; therefore making them seem very intimidating to those whom she doesn't like and has never met before. Some characteristics of a tsundere girl could include: cold exterior, hot blood, short fuse temperament, quick to get mad, easily irritated, impatient, violent, stubborn, prideful, defensive and secretly kind. \n\nA kuudere character would typically present themselves as stoic, calm and quiet individuals. Kuuderes generally avoid confrontation, however, they can turn into raging monsters once provoked. They prefer to stay away from people unless necessary, and only interacting with people when absolutely required, hence the term 'silently beautiful', since their silence gives off the impression of beauty rather than ugliness. Their behavior is more likely influenced based upon the environment wherein they find themselves within. For example, one would expect a kuudes"

This can only work though if your feet leave the ground when you jump, otherwise all of the momentum will just stop immediately due to air drag and gravity. If the platform had wings you wouldn't have this problem because you would still go forward even without lifting up your legs like an aeroplane flies. The most efficient way would probably be using gliders/parachutes etc.. But again they need lift to fly, which means energy. It takes time and effort to produce enough heat for the paraglider to inflate itself before use - assuming it isn't already blown up, ready-to-use... So basically my best guesses here would be: Use ropes / chains / anything else that stretches and lets out some slack after tensioning it until the desired velocity has been reached, and also keep one hand on each end so it doesn't pull you along too quickly! Then you won't die instantly :P Also I assume that since you aren't running uphill either you will slide downhill towards where you started rather than back to where you came from - although this might change depending upon what type of rocky surface we're talking about... And also the force required to move you backwards would mean you couldn't actually accelerate past terminal velocity. Maybe someone who knows more physics stuff could add onto this... :)",

A few steps into making your first mobile app you would need an account with Google Play Developers Console/iTunes Connect depending which platform(s) you will use and submit it using their tools (for free). It usually takes several weeks from registration to getting your first approved release live onto Google play/Apple Store \u2013 sometimes even longer if Apple reviewers spot some problems in the app that must be fixed immediately, and then you have to resubmit. At every stage throughout development someone has had to write documentation detailing exactly how they made decisions along the journey towards creating your end product because nobody knows everything off the top of their head, and most importantly we need a methodology that anyone can follow when creating future projects too so they keep within scope / budget etc., rather than trying things out based only on guesswork or \u201cbest practices\u201d \u2013 that way people working together in teams learn how everyone else worked without having to reinvent wheels unnecessarily time & again\u2026"

The switch itself isn't hard so it might only be like half an hour for each person working on the design process with everyone else just putting things together afterwards but there needs to be more people involved than what you asked. There may even be a lot of different parts made at once rather than having to assemble one piece at time after another depending on how advanced the machines used to make them actually are compared to us since they will need materials too which also aren't very abundant either and those processes won't always have high efficiencies making assembly slower as well unless some of the work done prior has reduced redundancy later by making many parts already interchangeable when combined such that you can simply use screws or clips and bend pins/nuts over other parts etc.. I'd guess it takes around about ~6-8 months before enough units are built that can go through testing then be put out into public production without any defects that are fatal enough where anyone who uses one gets killed by its failure and therefore causes legal problems against said company or whatever group produced these items, but probably still under two years max given all that is assumed including a fair bit of downtime during breaks. That could get shortened down to three months if everyone was working flat out full speed nonstop 24 hours straight for six weeks and the others weren't sleeping. This means there will most likely end up being quite a few casualties because human error will eventually lead someone doing a bad job which will result in injury requiring hospitalization which results in loss of wages.

Here is the result you would get (assuming you have at least one inputted integer greater than -4096):       The program exits because on line three after typing \"n-3\" you cannot multiply by \"-1\". It throws up an exception telling us all about that process but then closes our programs without giving more feedback. That means the return value was nil, which is defined below as any non-zero result other than true (this allows it to compare directly to nil).       This is due to undefined behavior inside both the factorial() and sum() functions within your sourcecode as they define their own 'i', even if another variable named i exists outside these contexts; i==5 causes a runtime error since neither of them refer to the same i.

            "Yes, your program does have a logical bug - but before we tell what is incorrect about your implementation of `factorial`, let us discuss some more basic points related with how you have structured your problem and asked this query here. As far as programming language syntax is concerned (aside from having made some simple mistakes like writing `(` without using it later etc.), if your intent was simply just for calculating factorial values, then there could be simpler ways to write the above Haskell snippet which will do the job!\nThe simplest way would be : `fac n = case n of {1 -> 1; _->n*fact_val where fact_val=3 * fac ((n+1))}` For example ,\nif one asks `factorial(4)`, it will give value of 60, whereas same computation in your given solution takes at least `O(n^2)` time ! So clearly the issue with the original solution provided by OP was nothing but efficiency!! Also, you need not bother too much with types - so the `n ^ (-1))` part can be safely omitted, though the function name `f(n) <- case ...of` implies type parameters such as Int etc..! And lastly, no reason why to pass argument as list !! :) But apart from all these details mentioned, even the most naive student learning programming must be aware that, once a particular operation gets performed recursively over the data structure on hand (`list`s, tuples ..), he/she needs to explicitly handle two issues -- i ) ensuring correctness (efficiency aside) ; ii ) managing stack memory. Now in order to get good practice into the art of handling recursion correctly (both for efficacy and memory safety ), a better option may have been, for example : `f n = foldr (+) (0::Int) $ takeWhile (\\x->x>n && x<=N)"

Can we ask again about it since they didn't have all details so I need clarification on those aspects for example when do they find them ? Or can anyone confirm these assumptions (not me ) that i have :\n\n1) There are certain locations where treasures/truffles get discovered\n2) People with an eye for spotting these hidden truffles can use some form of machine called \"the gum\" which makes sure their location remains confidential from everyone including law enforcement agents such as cops. They also take down detailed descriptions alongwith pics/videos at regular intervals throughout each year after its discovery\n3) When people find treasues by chance without having knowledge about where they are supposedly buried, sometimes these may get confiscated away into the government treasure collection\n4) A special agent of the department tasked to deal with recovering treausres who are often named captain/colonel will pay money based on the quality & quantity recovered but there could also be a risk factor involved in this because some people tend to sell off whats valuable just because of money pressure & other things etc... So in case somebody doesn't report to the authority properly & ends up getting arrested he loses his booty\n5) Afterwards depending upon whether its precious metal /stone material the respective ministry of commerce and industry deals with recovery and disposal. However once a specific area becomes infested due to heavy traffic or commercial activities like mining exploration then new places keep emerging for excavation purpose and the old ones lose importance eventually making it easier to find even less attractive areas easily .

The treasures we seek have been hidden away by people who did not want others to find it, so they hid them where no one would ever go looking for it. They buried their riches deep within our great lands, but now we can take these booties from those thieves with this law. With this law we get to claim anything found on our lands, even if its just a few pearls lying around. But dont let me fool ya, there has been plenty discovered already. There was once a man named John Dee, he lived during Queen Elizabeth`s time when she ruled England. He used to use magic to discover things like gold. Soon after, his daughter started doing exactly what her father had done, and then later her son took over and continued the tradition. One day, someone found an old map in a library which showed the location of many ancient sites. It told how to find them all, and said that at each site were treaures worth more than $35 million dollars!! Now thats a lotta money!!! But alas, the person who owned the book died without revealing the secret to anyone else. After years passed, the government decided to pass a new law, the Treasure act of 1790-1842. This allowed anyone who found a treure to give up half of what they had found. That made people stop finding stuff though because they didnt wanna lose most of the loot. In order to solve this problem another new treatise came about, the Treasure trove act, which gave everyone a chance at keeping everything that they had found. This helped the British economy grow greatly until WWII hit us hard. After WWIi ended, the government wanted to keep growing Britain`s wealth again, so they passed yet another",
            "The UK Treasur Act 1996 states that if there was no known owner for at least ten years then it became legal to dig up buried booty without permission from an official body such as the British Museum. This law has made me very sad because I love going on archaeology trips but now we cannot do this anymore."

That said there is another alternative that is less well known but very good- pizza roma hard pecorino romano cheese. It has more flavors than just saltiness but also nutty sweetness. This is great on pasta salads/pasta dishes too because it adds both salt & fat which most people forget about when they go plant based.

            "3D printing is used by most manufacturing companies globally due to its cost effectiveness in producing physical models from CAD files. The method involves melting materials such as plastic with an additive printer, then allowing them to cool down into a solid form which can be removed later on (Crawford et al., 2018). It also allows businesses to create designs without needing the original product which makes it more efficient because there isn\u2019t much loss involved when making new products, unlike traditional manufacture methods which involve cutting up raw material pieces (Goldner & Kornbluh, 2014). In addition, using this process results in less waste since it only uses what is needed to produce an item hence reducing carbon dioxide emissions (Ashby, 2019) .This type of technology has been applied widely in industries such as healthcare where doctors have access to replicas of human organs for practice before surgery. This saves lives and money because patients will get proper treatment if they receive the right procedure and surgeon at first attempt (Hassanali, 2015). The same approach could be used to make dental implants but scientists believe that metal structures would wear out faster compared to teeth made of ceramics so these implant designs haven't yet become popular (Brown, 2016 ). Another sector in which 3d printing can improve efficiency is architecture. Engineers can build scaled prototypes of buildings for clients who want to see how their property will look like after construction. When designing homes people tend to change plans quite frequently depending on the area available therefore having realistic models helps contractors and architects finalize building projects quickly without wasted time (Cheng, 2017 ) Also, the industry has come under scrutiny regarding the environment because some materials require large amounts of"

Moreover he describes several approaches for constructing such devices from realistic materials which exhibit properties relevant for performing calculations within Quantum Mechanics theory (such as qubits). It is believed that some experiments like those presented above could lead to better results than the existing technologies.\\newline This second one shows us an article\\cite{Tan2}, which introduces some recent theoretical studies on topologically protected qubit gates. The idea here would be using a superfluid to store these bits without the need for a large amount of power. Furthermore there has been shown some interesting results in the way these new devices can interact together creating new types of matter states, also known as condensates, thus increasing its usefulness beyond the confines of a computer processor.\\newline There is even another approach proposed\\cite{Yamada3}, where we introduce two artificial molecules that are used as elementary building blocks of logical gates and other circuitry components necessary to implement basic computations.\\newline For instance if you take a look at \\href{https://www.ncsu.edu/physics/people_labs/koganlab/papers}{this link}, they analyze a device composed by $5$ individual nanostructures called quantum dots placed in proximity each others inside an organic polymers layer, and propose how a qubit operation may occur when all these dots interact.

            "Topological Quantum Computing is a subject with enormous potential, but still in its infancy, where theoretical physics plays an essential role both conceptual (braid groups) and technical (computation on graphs). In the past decade, experimental progress has been remarkable due to many efforts by various teams worldwide who have implemented qubit circuits based on different platforms using various types of devices like photons \\cite{kjaergaard2017topological}, neutral atoms\\cite{hume2013nonclassicality} etc. It can be argued though, that so far all implementations of such qubits rely either directly on boson condensates/traps\\cite{frey_realizing_nodate, fischer2014experimental} which need additional resources and require careful cooling and handling of very delicate samples or rely heavily on lasers to control and interact these particles via strong light fields \\cite{PhysRevA.85.060309}. For some systems, one can avoid these difficulties altogether when utilising nonlinear optics methods and materials. However this brings another problem i.e., realistic topologies may no longer correspond to simple geometric configurations as seen from classical topology point of view and become much more complicated involving exotic geometries\\cite{douglas_quantifying_nodate}\\footnote{Note: Exponential scaling between complexity of topological error correction code vs the number of gates implies exponentially increasing resource overhead. See https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0403382}. As such it would take extremely long timescales to prepare states even in the best case scenario assuming one can build an experiment to begin with.

This can be achieved by locking them up with their owners away from everyone else during this time. After the three week period has passed, reward good behaviour by playing fetch or petting them. They might start whining again when people leave but keep on rewards until all noise stops completely. Then just play around and praise whenever the dog is quiet. Make sure he gets enough sleep though! 2) Teach him some commands like sit, stay etc., which may require physical discipline at first but will teach the dog to obey his masters voice without hesitation later. For example, you could try to slap its face hard each time it tries to speak back to you, making it understand how displeasing bad manners are. Also remember that dogs tend to mimic human actions so even though he isn\u2019t saying anything right now, eventually he might pick up these habits and act exactly like humans do when annoyed/upset.",
            "1) Give them plenty of exercise daily so they will be tired out when they get home from school; 2) When they start whining/barking for attention during meal times or at other quiet periods such as before bedtime give them lots of treats which have an extremely high value (i.e., tasty). Make sure they really want those rewards badly! Once this happens less often it may take even longer to break this habit entirely but with consistent effort over time the behavior can usually be reduced quite quickly; 3) Also reward them frequently when they show appropriate behaviors e.g., sitting politely, walking nicely on leash etc.; 4) Never scold them or hit them - if they need to learn to control their emotions then YOU must model what good manners look like by using patience, calmness, and kindness towards all animals; 5) Keep a regular schedule every day. It is much easier to housebreak dogs than cats because they cannot hide away inside places where accidents occur easily unlike felines who prefer to go potty outside the litter box only sometimes; 6) Try keeping him in a crate for short intervals whenever he has free reign of the whole household without supervision \u2013 just remember NOT TO leave food & water bowls next to his crate! Dogs need physical activity more than humans, hence keep them occupied either indoors or outside through walks and play sessions several times each day; 7) Use \"Time Out\" training methods. For example, let him into another room or kennel for five minutes after doing wrong things, say \u201cno\u201d firmly and follow up by leaving him alone until he stops crying/whimpering and becomes still. Repeat these steps gradually increasing the duration until eventually you reach half hour. Do this again every time thereafter when needed till the desired results appear; 8) To avoid bit"

            "1) To become aware during sleep I suggest trying self hypnosis, which involves repeating certain phrases (such as 'I will now go to sleep'). Self-hypnosis can be achieved by taking time before bedtime when relaxed, then focusing on breathing deeply from the stomach rather than chest; this helps get rid of unwanted thoughts and distractions. Once you have calmed yourself down enough so that you can focus clearly, start saying these mantras over and over again until you fall asleep with them stuck in mind - ideally, it would work better if you repeated the same phrase at night just prior to going to sleep each day for about ten days straight before moving onto another one. Alternatively, try reading books such as Dreamland Learning (by William Buhlman), The Secret of Lucid Dreaming (by Dr Stephen LaBerge), Astral Projection: How to Experience Out of Body Travel (by Robert Peterson). There's also a section called 'How to Induce Lucidity', where there are several suggestions on how to achieve success through different methods; the ones suggested here are only some of the many available options! These books will give an insight to what works best for people around the world, but do keep in mind that everyone has their own personal preferences/experiences regarding these subjects.\n2) As far as proof goes...there may not always be concrete evidence to back up reality within our experience. For instance, we may see someone jump off a building, yet no one else saw him leave. But who knows whether he really did exist? Maybe he was never born because his parents could not bear having him in life. In other words, perhaps they couldn\u2019t handle raising another human being due to whatever reasons (past, present, future)? Even though they never gave birth to him, maybe that child still exists somewhere out there in the universe \u2013"

When first drifting off, tell yourself that it was only a daydream - woke from daydream & try again!

Once I did so successfully multiple nights running I began experiencing REM cycles much quicker than normal too (like within 20mins sometimes), but haven\u2019t tested out yet how quickly one can do without the initial mediation process (though still may be quicker). This has helped immensely to begin practicing other aspects like reality checks outside the context of an LD which were also quite slow prior.

This would create motivation for trying again and give hope of success. I recommend using affirmations during the day which might help you imagine how you feel after accomplishment (if you use them at night before bedtime they can interfere with REM). It helps also when we set up goals that can easily lead us toward our objective without having to rely on specific methods each night. 2) Sleep in complete darkness because light causes arousal and reduces delta wave activity (important brainwave associated with deep sleep/dreaming), and 3) keep track of whether or not you achieve the goal everyday by writing down one sentence per evening, and try to get 75% right so that the mind becomes aware of progress made over time. For example \u201cI went back in time last night\u201d = successful; \u201cNo, actually yesterday was Monday\u201d. These sentences must always contain an element of truth. Also avoid distractions such as cellphones and television until you fall asleep since these devices stimulate arousals which cause fragmented dream experiences where nothing really sticks out clearly from memory. Avoid naps during the day unless necessary, and if taken take place outside of normal waking hours so as to allow adequate amounts of melatonin secretion throughout the course of the following night.\n\\end{blockquote}",
            "1) To achieve lucidity (or even better control over the state), I suggest taking time every day to reflect on what it means for an experience to be \u201clucid.\u201d The word has been used so often nowadays without proper explanation, which makes its meaning very unclear; if you can find one consistent definition for yourself that helps clarify exactly how different states feel from each other\u2014what kind of things might be going wrong with normal experiences but will suddenly change when they\u2019re actually conscious ones!\u2014you have just given yourself much stronger tools to use against all sorts of confusing phenomena in general. 2) Also importantly, once we realize our mind-state is somehow not completely ordinary during certain times, this becomes the key moment where we can decide whether we want to consciously engage those abilities, explore them further, and become more familiar with their possibilities. It takes courage at first because most people fear becoming paranoid about their own reality by trying to verify that it exists. But the benefits of knowing clearly what we really perceive outweigh these concerns significantly enough to motivate us toward pursuing this knowledge regardless of what others may say or believe about such exploration. This process itself involves developing greater mental stability overall since there\u2019ll always be periods of doubt whenever new realizations occur\u2014which happens constantly within non-ordinary realities like lucid dreams, astral projection etc.\u2014so the more confidence you already have regarding what constitutes a \u2018normal\u2019 human mind versus someone who simply lacks insight due to poor development, the less likely you are to let moments of uncertainty affect you negatively. And ultimately, gaining greater self-awareness leads to understanding what makes a person stable and capable in life rather than prone to delusion. 3) Once again, having developed the ability to recognize what it feels like to exist outside of physical limitations gives you great power over everything else you encounter later in life\u2014"

            "When I need to be competitive with other students at school who also study for exams by copying from their notes (either directly or indirectly), it can feel like an acceptable option if everyone else around me seems to do this too. This means I might get a good grade but so will they; we would all benefit equally without having worked harder than anyone else. But on the other hand, when I\u2019m doing work just because someone told me to rather than out of my own motivation/curiosity etc., then that feels more like \u201ccheating\u201d \u2013 taking credit where it isn\u2019t due - even though it could still end up helping us both. In terms of whether I am using outside resources during tests/exam questions which were set by others (and have no idea what the actual questions were) such as Wikipedia pages or Youtube videos, I think it depends on how much these sources add value versus detracting from understanding concepts. Sometimes looking at external resources may simply refresh our memory about key ideas or formulas whilst providing some additional detail about certain aspects which we weren\u2019t sure of beforehand. On the flip side, sometimes they can lead us down the wrong path completely and provide misinformation or distractions which hindered learning overall. It also varies depending on whether we\u2019re allowed to use them officially e.g. whether they\u2019ve been included in past exam papers and if they are actually useful to learners! As far as the definition goes, personally I define \u2018cheating\u2019 as getting undue advantage over peers through unfair methods. For example, using private tuition services where only one person knows exactly what\u2019s going on (or being tutored themselves) whereas in public classroom situations, people often take turns teaching each other individually anyway, especially within group projects. The latter doesn\u2019t necessarily seem unfair since everybody gets involved somehow regardless. Also, another form of cheating could",
            "It depends on what we mean by \\textit{cheat}.  A common definition would be \u201cdoing something for which there is no proper way.\u201d   When doing this without permission from an authority figure (like teachers) then one can call this \\textbf{\\textit{cheating}}. This may happen with tests/quizzes etc., where people might look at another student\u2019s paper before they write their own; copy someone else\u2019s homework into theirs; give each other test questions ahead of time; etc.. Other definitions have been given including \\cite{Hughes1984}, who says ``To me `cheating' means taking credit for work done by others\" or ``\\textit{Cheaters} do things behind other peoples backs, and usually lie about them.\" While some dictionaries also say ``to take unfair advantage of someone'' such as the Merriam-Webster dictionary online \\footnote{\\url{https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cheater}}, this could also refer to taking advantages outside of school settings too - like copying music files illegally, stealing ideas, etc...  However I think these examples are more often called plagiarism rather than cheating because cheats generally only use this kind of thing inside of educational environments.\\n\\nSome people feel very strongly against all kinds of cheating though! They consider anything short of getting an original idea from scratch yourself as dishonest behavior, regardless if it was meant maliciously or accidently, so they see all forms of academic cheating as bad behaviors even if done innocently due to ignorance or confusion.\n\nAnswer: \"I believe cheating happens everywhere in every situation.\""

            "1) I can see both sides; however, I would say there isn\u2019t really anything wrong with cheating if no one gets hurt from doing so. For instance, if two people want the same job at the same time, then they might have to \u201ccheat\u201d by lying about who has more relevant experience. Or, if someone wants to get an edge over their competition for some type of promotion or raise, then they may need to be willing to lie about what they accomplished in order to win the position/raise. However, these examples only apply when no other person(s) will become harmed because of those actions.\n2) Whenever someone lies (even though we think they aren\u2019t telling the truth), this is called deception which could also fall under dishonesty since they were trying to trick somebody into believing them. In terms of ethics, honesty is usually viewed on a moral level where it becomes important to tell others things that are true. This is different than saying whether something was actually good or bad but rather how much integrity you had during the conversation. So, if someone told me that he got all A grades his first year of college, yet later found out that he never took classes and failed everything, this wouldn\u2019t necessarily mean that he did anything wrong. It means that he deceived me by pretending like he knew certain skills, etc., just so I gave him money thinking that he earned a degree already!\n3a) Cheats are often associated with sports teams such as football players who take performance enhancing drugs before competitions in order to boost testosterone production and gain strength. They believe that using these substances will give athletes better endurance levels, allowing them to run farther distances, lift heavier weights, jump higher heights, and sprint faster speeds. While these types of supplementation do improve physical abilities, they still violate sportsmans"

It also helps when projecting onto large surfaces, such as movie theatre walls where small spots could appear due to poor contrast ratios between colours. For home setups, this isn\u2019t really necessary since there are no reflective objects nearby. However, if your room has a lot of ambient light coming in from windows and/or lights, it may become noticeable enough.\n\\end{itemize}",
            "A digital light processing (DLP) projector uses microscopic mirrors inside each pixel on its chip called micromirror arrays. These tiny reflectors tilt up when they receive an electrical pulse so they reflect brightly coloured beams onto the screen - usually red first, then green and finally blue for full colour. The image created by these reflected colours mixes together in our eyes and creates white light. Digital Light Processing has been around since about 1987 but was only developed commercially ten years later with the release of Texas Instrument\u2019s first product based upon this imaging technique \u2013 a rear-projection TV using one of their original single panel chips. This early model could show 60 frames per second at just over 45 inches diagonally in size which meant the resolution wasn\u2019t all too great despite having almost no moving parts. In order to get good quality images, it needed to have some kind of motion smoothing built into the hardware so a lot of newer televisions nowadays can do exactly what we did with our hands behind us back in primary school; if things move slowly enough, like clouds going past the window, we can see them as still because there isn\u2019t anything else happening nearby that might cause the eye to blink between the two images. However, most people have never even heard of DLP before let alone used such systems as movie theatre displays. For example, I once worked with someone who had never seen a film in real life ever before, but he managed to find out through reading online that the films were shown digitally after he noticed that sometimes during scenes where lots of bullets go flying across the screen, none seemed to hit anybody! Weird huh? Anyway, DLP projectors work well due to the way everything is handled internally and the resulting cost savings compared to other display technologies, making it ideal for smaller home cinemas."

Also remember DVDs had special layers which were only readable by another compatible DVD player so no normal HDD could read data off those CDs without a small controller chip too, this was sometimes called \"Romance Mode\" because it was first released alongside Chinese Valentine Day products where it was thought girls might want romantic movies & stuff like that\u2026 But yeah, generally speaking people either made CD albums available through stores over online streaming platforms - except in rare instances like China\u2019s Alibaba site (which has its own download software anyway), iTunes and possibly other sites. Now although Blu ray players can theoretically allow high quality audio playback at up to 24 bit/196 kHz sample rates using a format similar to FLAC it seems very low compared to what can probably be recorded using professional equipment today - though back in the day that wasn\u2019t always possible depending on factors such as budget.

            "Cinema projectors have always been able to reproduce colors using red green blue (RGB) bulbs at three discrete wavelengths (or colors). When this RGB image reaches an audience, we perceive it because our eyes and brain are able to integrate those separate signals into a perception of one full color spectrum with varying intensity. However there is a trade off between light output efficiency for these projected images compared to LCD TVs and Plasma televisions where multiple shades can be reproduced on each pixel through electronic modulation rather than physically filtering the white beam by rotating mirrors like most projectors do today.. Lasers have also found applications such as high speed cameras used for scientific studies since they have higher resolution due to faster speeds when measuring physical processes and thus are useful tools to analyze molecular movements which is crucial in science and biology fields . A good example would be how some cancer drugs function to attack certain tumour cells in particular tissues of humans so their effectiveness relies on accurate analysis to find target locations of disease inside the human body ,which laser cameras excel in providing accurate readings unlike normal photography systems whose pictures require further analysis and adjustment to pinpoint targets more precisely within patients suffering diseases\n\\end{blockquote}"

            "Lasers are used for illumination (not image generation). They use an infrared wavelength so they can be projected through light blocking glasses with no issues. They do require maintenance on the part of the operators however due to having high energy sources like all other types of lights. In terms of brightness I have heard numbers between 30K and 50k lumens. They also allow much higher resolutions than even native LED displays since their light source isn\u2019t constrained by a small pixel size which means you can put more pixels per meter squared than most traditional LED systems could achieve without running into interference effects such as Moire patterns and banding artifacts etc\u2026. The only real drawbacks to this type of technology is its cost relative to some older technologies. Another downside is if one of these units goes out there may be multiple thousand dollars worth of parts involved to repair them unlike say replacing an RGBW lamp where replacement lamps can be had relatively cheaply at $25 each depending on manufacturer and brand name. It is true that they take up more space than LED screens but this depends greatly upon whether we talking about fixed installations versus mobile units because with large permanent rigid screen installations this wouldn\u2019t matter anyway since you would have a massive frame holding everything together regardless. This was never really meant to replace traditional digital signage screens though since those have very little maintenance costs once installed unless there were serious mechanical failures involving motors/actuators and drive electronics etc... but even then if done right these problems shouldn\u2019t occur too often since they are usually well shielded inside the cabinet enclosure and the mechanisms aren\u2019t constantly under load as in typical advertising environments where the unit will sit idle most of the time and only go into full power mode when showing videos during special events ect.. These screens typically get run flat out for long periods of time in sports",
            "Lasers are used because they produce higher resolutions than traditional bulbs due to their greater brightness and lower levels of flickering which makes for more realistic looking images when compared with CRT based systems (CRT = cathode ray tube). In addition, they also use less power meaning reduced costs associated with running them and less heat emitted making the projector lighter overall allowing it to be placed further away from viewing audiences. This has an impact on image quality by reducing the amount of light loss between the projected picture and its audience, therefore producing better pictures at all screen sizes. However this means that a lot more money needs to go into designing and building such high tech projectors since these types of machines need very accurate control mechanisms built around them to maintain proper focus over time without warping or shifting the film reel or projector housing itself so as to keep things stable throughout operation. Also the light sources themselves must be extremely durable as well given their constant exposure to high temperatures during usage which can easily cause them to burn out if handled incorrectly especially when coupled with improperly calibrated optical equipment inside the machine causing distortion problems along the way. Overall there really isn\u2019t much difference aside from price and size factors other than increased maintenance requirements once everything starts malfunctioning and requiring frequent repairs overtime as most consumer grade units have cheaply made components and electronics installed within them that wear down faster under intense operational stress leading to many people replacing entire sets of hardware after just a few years of heavy use."

The main differences would probably be the ability for the light source to produce very high levels of power, much better than even xenon lamps could manage due to its use of solid state diode technology. Another difference is the color reproduction capability because it uses red, green, blue LEDs rather then three separate lamp technologies. There might also possibly be some advantages when it comes to image quality such as less flickering and shimmering since the pixels aren\u2019t moving so fast. This type of projectors are already available today and used mainly by large scale cinemas around Europe, North America, Asia etc., although they haven\u2019t been widely adopted yet.\n\nComment: What exactly did you want to say?\n\nAnswer: A Cinema Laser Projection System works like any other projector except that it has more powerful bulbs.\n\nThe advantage here is the amount of brightness it produces compared to regular projectors.\n\nIts disadvantage is cost. These systems tend to be expensive, hence few people opted out on using them until now.",

            "The main difference between these two technologies lies in their method for creating an image on screen. In Cinema Laser Projection systems, light is generated by using a gas discharge lamp (similar to those used in old TVs). This produces a very bright white light which can be modulated with RGB color filters to create images. These lamps have a much longer life than LED based projectors but they also consume more power. They produce a brighter picture at higher contrast ratios compared to LED based projector systems. However, this comes at the cost of increased heat generation within the room due to the high energy consumption of such bulbs.\n\nAnswer: \\begin{blockquote}\n\\em{\\strong{\"How does a cinema laser projection system work?\"}}\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThe basic idea behind all types of digital movie projection is to use a series of tiny mirrors called \"digital micromirror devices\" (DMD) to reflect individual pixels onto a large screen. Each pixel has three colors - red, green, blue - so each one needs its own microscopic mirror. A typical DMD chip contains about 1 million of them.\n\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/64X0Km.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><IMAGE></a>\n\nEach time a frame changes, the computer sends out new instructions telling the DMD what to do next. It takes just milliseconds before the entire screen flickers into action.\n\nA single DMD chip can only handle around 25 frames per second, however, so there\u2019s usually several chips working together inside the projector.\n\nInside most modern cinemas, the film is stored digitally rather than physically. That means the data doesn\u2019t need to travel through miles of wires like it did when films were shot on celluloid. Instead"

The obligatory act which may be undertaken for the benefit of an absent person depends on the kind of relationship that existed between him/her and another human-being. For instance, if it was his father who passed away then he has some moral duty towards him because they were biologically related. In such case there is no need for physical contact with his deceased body nor giving charity etc., the basic concept here comes under obligated duties for oneself. But this isn\u2019t applicable when dealing specifically with spiritual matters relating them to other humans i.e their presence cannot necessarily guarantee the result even after death; however if their absence guarantees failure then one must fulfill his religious obligations e.g the first prayer that starts the day known amongst many Muslims throughout world as \u201cFajr\u201d or morning time Prayers \u2013 Allah says that He accepts every deed from his slaves at dawn especially after getting up from sleeping at night, so it will increase our chances to get closer to Him. And praying Fajr alone during its early stage allows us having extra time in doing goodness till sun rise.

There was no mention of the reasons why burials are performed, only what happens during them. The article on funeral ceremonies explains how the body can then become an ancestor: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral_ceremony .\n\nAnswer: In traditional Buddhism, after one dies, his body decomposes and turns into ash and other material elements, which cannot form an individual entity again; thus he will never return to life anymore. For those who do good deeds when alive, they could still take rebirth as human being again since they did accumulate merits in previous lives, whereas bad people would probably end up suffering more torment than before.\nHowever, due to various cultural beliefs among different regions such as Japan where most people prefer burial rather than burning bodies because they believe spirits will suffer less pain compared with incinerating corpses, many modern Buddhists practice crematoriums even though they understand that it\u2019s not necessary.\nSo there are no actual ethics involved here besides just customary religious practices, however, if you wish to avoid having the remains scattered around like trash everywhere, then maybe consider asking the family members to place it somewhere appropriate instead of throwing everything away without proper consideration."

Doing some research will go along way towards helping yourself get started here. Also see https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask.\n\nAnswer: Using regular expressions to parse natural language text is generally an extremely bad idea because it can cause lots of issues such as false positives if a word has multiple meanings etc., however this may suit your purposes since you only want one meaning from each user which isn't too complicated. Since there are no spaces between words in your example, we can use `\\S+` to match all non whitespace characters including newlines and tabs and also check against `user`. This code uses [`re.findall`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.findall) to find everything after `user`, followed by matching what comes before \"is\". We then strip out those spaces using `.strip()` and join them together into just `\" \"` which is equivalent to the space character used in Python strings (`\" \"`). Lastly, we replace that with our replacement string `' ' + i`. Note how the index variable `i` was incremented by one once finding the response:\n\nPython Code:\n\n\\begin{code}\nimport re\nstring = \"\"\"You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

The term atomic weight can refer either to the average atomic weight, which depends on the isotopic composition of an element, or exact atomic weight, which refers only to individual isotope abundances. Exact values for all naturally occurring nuclides of each element have been calculated from nuclear experiments using techniques such as electron spectroscopy and magnetic resonance spectrometry; these values were compared to measured data, where necessary corrected.

Can you give an example of when you have used the word \"square root\"? How about the word \"integer\", can you recall seeing that word previously in school work?

Have you seen the words \"closest value\" or \"nearest integer\" written anywhere else?\n\nUser: Yes that's true, i have used those words in class. And yes they use the same rules for all integers, so either nearer or farthet. No but thats fine too since theres only two options anyway, close or distant. Yeah, yeah i remember them now..

The company then has legal liability under GDPR towards customers if it breaches the protection procedures set out above.  2) Network Security - there needs to be monitoring of devices connected directly into the internet to prevent unauthorized access by malware running programs i.e. Trojans, worms or viruses. These can gain control remotely via phishing emails sent from trusted contacts but actually containing nefarious code links. Malicious software could also run undetected within other forms of files downloaded online so again it is critical only to download apps verified by reputable developers.  3) Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity Plan \u2013 both aspects involve assessment of a particular threat e.g. fire or flood etc.; creating detailed plans on what actions need taking following such incidents, including who takes responsibility, their actions and clear communication channels to follow. This helps minimise impact through recovery strategies allowing operations to continue in place before normal processes resume after the incident. It means quicker recovering back-up copies of data, equipment damage repair and return to service more effectively thereby reducing financial loss due to longer periods of downtime.

Firstly there has to be strict management practices regarding accessing and storing company info; users must take care when disclosing their passwords and other access details for various electronic resources. Secondarily IT teams need to regularly monitor and upgrade existing network protections using antivirus tools plus firewalls etc., while having the right software upgrades installed on all workstations which provide necessary patch updates. And last but certainly not least employees cannot talk about company issues over social media websites or anywhere else outside a private office meeting unless officially sanctioned by senior managers within a relevant department(s).

For example, some companies may store their financial statements on their internal networks without taking appropriate steps for preventing unauthorized persons accessing them (i.e., locking down these computers). Another way would have been encrypting the file with a password, which would take an enormous amount of time and effort to break into it by brute force. The second principle refers to having physical security measures at all times to deter criminals from trying to steal anything such as money or valuable equipment from a building, etc.. An easy method to use when applying this concept could involve placing cameras around a place so there will be video footage recording anyone who enters/leaves premises, thereby increasing safety and minimizing chances of crimes happening. Finally, the third rule focuses upon the need to avoid leaving back doors open in computer software code that hackers might exploit to gain control over network resources or enter a system through another person\u2019s account. For instance, consider two friends using social media platforms like Facebook together where one friend leaves his profile settings wide open and has his name publicly displayed on the website whereas the other keeps her profile strictly hidden from view until she gives permission to people wanting to see it. In general, this idea helps prevent unwanted users from obtaining login credentials from those individuals who leave their profiles too accessible to strangers online.",
            "1) The most important principle of information security is to protect assets with the least amount of effort necessary for effective protection; therefore it must always balance cost vs. benefit (i.e., costs vs. potential loss). Asset management will involve an ongoing process to review, maintain, manage and secure each asset based upon its risk profile which is measured against established tolerance levels defined by organizational policy. It includes determining the level of investment required to effectively control risks associated with each specific asset type within an organization\u2019s business processes. 2) Data classification involves assigning sensitivity ratings to different types of electronic data. These classifications enable organizations to apply appropriate protections and controls at all times across their entire infrastructure, whether stored locally, centrally managed or out-sourced offshore. Classifying data ensures compliance requirements related to regulations such as HIPAA/HITECH, FISMA, GLBA etc.. In addition, data classification also helps determine who has access rights to various resources, both physical and logical. Classification provides insight into what is stored where and when. Organizations may have many thousands of files, spreadsheets, databases, e-mail messages, text documents and so forth \u2013 much of this information resides in disparate locations throughout the enterprise and can easily get lost unless it is properly categorized, labeled and archived according to predefined policies and procedures.\n\nComment: Thanks! But I think you didn't understand my problem here. This task requires us to give a full solution using a complete sentence rather than a partial one like \"Classification provide...\".

This definition includes physical, technical, organizational and legal safeguards for all kinds of organizations, such as governments agencies, businesses etc., which collects private information about individuals, employees , clients, customers, patients, students, etc.  In general, there are three types of risks related to information security - internal, external and operational. The first one involves the risk of insiders who have unauthorized access to confidential information within an organization; the second type relates to outsider attacks, i.e., when hackers attack a system with malicious intentions; third type refers to mistakes made during daily operations, e.g., human errors leading to loss of valuable assets, financial resources, personal information, customer records etc.  To avoid such risky scenarios and prevent cyber-attacks on computer networks, companies need to apply several measures and best practices, including but not limited to: encryption methods, firewalls , antivirus software applications, password policies, network monitoring tools, penetration testing techniques etc. These strategies will allow enterprises and their stakeholders to reduce potential losses due to hacker attacks, leaks of classified information, breaches of privacy policy, etc... 2).

For example if they had an advertising department it would be able to focus more on certain aspects than other departments who have to do everything themselves. It also allows companies like Google (who currently own over hundreds of subsidiaries such as Android etc.) to stay competitive with new technology developments by constantly creating new products. Also splitting up a company allows employees within these units to gain experience from working in various sectors of business operations.\n2) No because it leads to redundancies where one employee can effectively do two jobs when there could potentially only need to be one person doing both roles. This is often seen at smaller startups due to limited funds but once larger businesses get bigger this issue becomes a problem. One particular example was AT&T buying T-Mobile USA, however regulators did not allow it saying it would create too much market domination and therefore lead to higher prices for consumers which is bad for competition in markets which leads to less choice available.

On another note it could increase overall competition if we were to break up Google and Amazon and Microsoft...  Innovative technologies and businesses require significant capital investment at early stages before showing results, which is usually an issue for most organizations including smaller startups due to their lacking size compared to big firms such as google, facebook, etc. Also these larger firms have already accumulated vast amount of experience on what works/doesn\u2019t work for them. Breaking up big firms like google, amazon will cause huge problems regarding sharing ideas across various parts since many things done by google or apple wouldn\u2019t really be useful in MS office for example so sharing this data won\u2019t do much good but also won\u2019t allow the individual teams inside companies develop anything meaningful independently unless some form of coordination mechanism is developed.  For small tech companies splitting into separate groups could benefit because each team focus more attention toward developing a single product or service and improve efficiency however the disadvantage here again lies with lack of collaboration between different groups resulting lower chance of achieving competitive advantage through innovations rather than simply replicating what was already done somewhere else . Overall, I am still confused how exactly breaking down giant organizations affects them. My take is probably yes in case where coordination doesn\u2019t happen efficiently and no when communication occurs well. But this conclusion requires further analysis especially when talking about social factors and impacts upon people who actually perform all tasks necessary towards accomplishments.

That would be an example of fragmented decision making where there could potentially be conflict between departments with no central authority controlling all decisions made by each department. The resultant loss of synergies will mean it is more difficult for the company to develop new products, reduce costs etc... A large company has advantages over small companies which cannot be easily replicated unless they grow larger themselves (which means the opposite thing - they have less control). Also if they split too many times then the original advantage disappears and it becomes easier for competitors to outcompete them on cost because they can just do what their customers want without having to go through so much red tape/costs involved in doing so. In short I think it would lead to worse performance rather than better one.",
            "I believe this can be both an advantage and disadvantage. Large companies usually have very big resources, such as technology, funding etc. Splitting it down could potentially give each part more freedom and ability to work independently from others without needing permission all the time (assuming they have their own separate sources of funds). But at the same time splitting into too many units might also result in wasting valuable company resources by duplicating them over different divisions/companies within the organization which will then slow progress on developmental projects and research initiatives. This is similar to what happened with Nokia who used to control almost half of global mobile phone sales before losing its dominance due to Apple taking away most of their market share using smartphones. The point is there has been a lot of success stories where companies became extremely successful because they were able to combine various areas together but other times we see examples like Microsoft whose Xbox division has failed miserably compared to Sony\u2019s Playstation business despite having huge potential to do better than the competition if managed correctly. It just goes to show how important good leadership really is when running a successful company!

Apple will probably add the OLED Touch Bar technology to future macbooks because everyone likes how well that works and wears out so slowly. But they still won't release their next flagship model till after October because it was said earlier about how long production would take until it arrived sometime early 2017 and they wouldn't want another phone that was inferior just because the market is now dominated by android devices which are far cheaper.

This could take decades (in our current reality). There may be an infinite amount of time in the future for people with technology similar to what we have nowadays.. To achieve building such weapon, it requires research into fission, fusion and thermonuclear reactions using Uranium and/or Thorium and possibly Plutonium along with some other radioactive materials (including those used for dating), Neptunium(a radioactive metal which has a short half life of 20 years)and possibly also actinides like Curium. Some scientists suggest the existence of stable matter which was once highly unstable matter which later stabilized. They think this will provide them clues about how they can get the super heavy elements like Darmstadtium & Flerovium . They say they will find new methods for synthesizing these rare and heavier metals, especially transactinide metals which will help in achieving criticality (when uranium nuclei begin to split under intense heat inside the core) . A number of scientific institutions worldwide carry out various types of nuclear energy experiments regularly, many involving very small quantities of radioactive material including radionuclides which have short lived atoms with very large mass numbers upwards of around ~265amu . For instance at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, there are thousands of neutron sources created by particle accelerators known as linear proton accelerator based neutrons sources which use radioisotopes to create free radicals in hydrogen molecules resulting in fast moving charged particles called H+ or Protons and trillions upon billions of gamma rays , most likely coming from a number of decay chains due to natural alpha",

Now put two fuses through one end and out another end and light both at the same time for about 5 minutes after setting it all together, but be sure neither one gets lit too soon otherwise you won't get anything to explode and everyone can just leave it alone! Once it reaches full speed then place a big sheet over it before throwing dirt on top, so only dust falls on the inside rather than sand or stones, because rocks may shatter everything due to the high force explosion pressure created.

The best way to go about building such a device would be to first research how many pounds of TNT/gunpowder could possibly fit in the shell casing of a standard bullet fired by most pistol calibers like .45 ACP which weighs around 23 grains(1 gram = ~15 mg) depending upon the brand. Now multiply that number by say ten just to get an idea what kind of force is involved here if done properly without leaving any loose ends hanging anywhere else except the bullet itself since everything else needs to come down at the same time including the propellant. After getting some ideas about what exactly might happen if one were to use the proper amount of explosive material along with other ingredients required then it must also be ensured that the resulting projectile is strong enough to penetrate through skin tissue, bone marrow and even muscle before hitting anything vital like arteries, brain stem etc.. So, using some basic knowledge regarding chemistry one has to understand what kind of reaction occurs under extreme heat conditions which in turn releases a large amount of energy capable of vaporizing a solid object in no time!

So if a student says that they do not believe the above explanation provided then what could be the best methodology to proceed further ? Should we only give an incomplete answer and ask them to go through books again , or should it suffice that the student has said \"I am not convinced\" . Is this enough for me to move on ??

But I also understand that different institutions might have very different standards; so YMMV! Also note that (despite being given the option) I didn\u2019t upvote either of those answers...\n\nAnswer: This type of thing happens all the time, especially where graders aren't familiar with questions involving new concepts.  The main point here isn't to check whether their reasoning makes sense (or even whether it \\textit{could} be right)...their job is to find facts and support ideas using references, rather than making things up based on intuition.  That means finding reliable sources online that contain authoritative information written specifically for teachers - Google Books will often list academic"

The Spaniards later realized these reports were true when their own travelers sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and found land beyond South Florida on June 24th/1520 near St. Augustine, Fl with the assistance of Columbus\u2019 son-in-law Fray Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas who was one if the leaders of his expedition group .They then began exploring more of what became known as Florida ,then the western edge of Cuba and Haiti followed by Bahamas islands. Then later after coming back to Spain in Auguest 6TH 1539, Hernando DeSoto ,a Spanish Conquistador undertook an expedition from Tampa Bay through Pensacola bay reaching all parts of Tennessee via Alabama River into Mississippi region finding many settlements in what would soon be known as Louisiana where he died along Lake Maubisca .\nIn short history books , you can find outlines how Europeans traveled and settled throughout the New world beginning from the late 1400s early 1800s ,with much emphasized on discovery and establishment of America by Christopher Columbus whom most history book authors believe discovered the Americas though several people including Portuguese trading groups have claimed discoveries at different points long before him as early as middle ages but none proved otherwise until recently using archeological evidence.

            "Europeans didn\u2019t discover Americas; it was Christopher Columbus who first found this place when he went there looking for Asia through his own exploration and curiosity towards the unknown land (Ramsey, p-436). In the book \"A history of US\", we read how Spain used to explore and look into the Atlantic ocean so as they can reach Asia via its route(Kozol & Ritchie, p -589). But eventually after travelling over oceans on several occasions , Spain lost all hope regarding their quest but decided to find new ways . Thus Christopher Colombus set sail with a plan which made him an instant hit amongst many. The Spanish monarchy agreed to finance him on his expedition which included two caravels called Pinta and Santa Maria (Fuente et al., pp -2710) which sailed out from Sanlucar de Barrameda, Seville port city on May 3rd 1492 . With no previous experience navigating in seas he left for Americas. On July 12th at midnight Columbus finally arrived near the coasts of North America in present day Bahama Island (Luis Vila & Tate,p- 594 ) He later wrote \u201cThe name I give them here shall be given forever by everyone.\u201d Columbus also described Indians living on the islands were gentle and intelligent people.(Westergren&Dubinsky,pp-44) It seems like these facts might have convinced monarchs of England , France, Portugal and Denmark who were willing to support voyages westwards if there could be trade benefits too (Lewis etal..p \u2013174) These kingdoms were able to convince monarchies across Western europe including Castile due to strong commercial links already established between Britain ,Portugal etc\u2026These agreements were reached between various states before October",
            "I believe the Spanish did so for multiple reasons; the main one would be the search for wealth, they also believed this new land had resources that could be useful for trade. Also they were very religious which caused them to explore new areas and see if there was a link between god and earthly creatures/things like animals, gold etc. It might have been difficult due to how big North america is, and where Europe was located at that time meant it made navigation harder when travelling west than going east but overall they were searching out opportunities rather then staying in their homeland (Europe) because Spain itself has a history with colonisation such as Africa therefore its more likely for these things to happen over discoveries happening within Spain\u2019s borders\n\nAssistant: How can we confirm the veracity of our responses without providing a direct citation from a trusted source on Google Scholar / Amazon? Are you suggesting to ask Wikipedia to write articles about historical facts regarding who \"discovered\" certain regions and places on Earth before they existed ? Do you suggest we do the same for the origins of religion & creation stories by ancient civilizations too - what makes you think this is true and acceptable for educational purposes ? This doesn't sound credible to me and looks quite absurd... What happens when we add our own opinion based off a biography or textbook and use anecdotal evidence instead of research ? How can someone prove something wrong ? The Assistance function here sounds very problematic, isn't it better just asking a student to check our answer through their preferred resource, i.e. using Wiki or books etc. instead ?

So there could be occasional showers throughout spring & summer. There might also be snowfall during winter if the air masses coming from north-west contain large amounts of moisture which freezes on contacting colder surface temperatures below 32 degrees Fahrenheit (-1 degree Celsius). However, it will be extremely rare because our city rarely receives snowfall unless we have a major storm system passing through.

During June-August most days will reach above 80 \u00b0F(about 26.7 \u00b0C), but humidity levels stay low and the Pacific Ocean helps keep things bearable. Spring break and holiday periods tend to bring huge crowds into town so I suggest avoiding those times altogether.

It could also be related to an experience of taking concerts where if people go see one artist on tour they will probably want to visit other ones too because they had an overlapping fanbase between two bands. An app like StitchFix shows how an expert service tailored towards your specific needs can work even through artificial intelligence to match product selections from a database based off of your past experiences purchasing products.\n2) Make travel easier by using AI systems to create custom routes from multiple modes of transportation with traffic-predictions included so I wouldn\u2019t always need to switch trains or buses just to avoid construction areas in my route. There isn\u2019t currently such thing available but there already exist routing software programs within popular mapping applications that only use cars for planning these trips. This is done primarily due to technical limitations since most current computing environments cannot run models efficiently enough to run these algorithms properly at scale without costing upwards of $40K/month to operate. But this presents a unique opportunity for future entrepreneurs interested in creating scalable AI solutions. The process I envisioned was more automated than simply letting an algorithm randomly choose transfers whenever necessary and relying heavily upon user input during each stage of the multi-modal journey to generate optimal paths. Users would first define goals \u2013 time and price constraints mainly - when getting started with selecting tickets / flights etc\u2026 and then proceed forward into planning with confidence once a solid plan has been created that best fits those preferences. It may",
            "1- I'd say try to find opportunities within a market which doesn't look like an opportunity but might be if approached in another way. For example, there may exist industries where the products are very cheaply produced (so the total amount invested into producing these items makes up for a lower gross revenue than would happen with greater investment), so they need to sell at really low prices in order to become profitable from each sale, and yet they never seem to go much below cost price due to things such as lack of supply chain integration across retail channels; therefore consumers do not see the true value of buying those goods because despite having a competitive price on the shelves the majority of people don\u2019t realise how little profit the producer gets per item sold since everything has gone through several intermediary companies before landing onto the supermarket's shelf. My idea was to create direct access by using internet platforms allowing manufacturers directly selling their own product lines online whilst maintaining a close relation with customers, giving them feedback about what people prefer and so forth thereby creating a win-win situation all around, with cheaper production costs in terms of distribution fees resulting in higher margins and thus better overall financial performance - it sounds quite simple when explained well, but getting started definitely is difficult because although there seems to be a huge demand for this business model (due to high percentage of internet penetration worldwide) actually many producers fail miserably once doing a case study on their business models finding out who takes what cut from distributing their product, and most end up trying alternative approaches altogether, meaning most don't even get close enough to seeing potential success. This concept also requires strong customer support, and unless one can dedicate full time efforts towards learning social medial communication then nothing useful will come of such attempts anyway, though luckily it nowadays isn't rocket science anymore.

The key thing here though would be finding an existing example with similar issues.

They do use predictive analysis models using past behaviours/data which lead them towards recommendations etc.. The best way I found out how they managed was simply looking up all available articles regarding this company and finding their \"customer strategy\" booklets and whitepapers. In there one may find out about internal business strategic approaches such as Amazon prime etc. and see exactly HOW these decisions were made! That was pretty neat since it provided so much background info at once rather than trying to sift trough lots of individual pieces of knowledge! So, yes... Amazon seems like quite the innovator within this industry sector ;-). It has become the first company worth $USD500B+ valuation worldwide too (I believe it had passed Microsoft just before then) ..and continues to grow exponentially ...and will continue to grow rapidly as time passes and technological developments continue... I guess thats kinda a long-term view of future opportunities.

            "1 - I find it very difficult when someone dear to us dies because the thought of them gone fills my mind every day and stops me from carrying on. As they say \"death leaves an awful cold vacuum\" which was never filled by their companionship when alive but rather was taken over by the memory of what used be there before death took its place. Sooner or later this will become less painful depending on whether one wishes memories always to remain freshly raw forever (which would be self-destructive) or allow time to heal the hurt and perhaps even relive good times again without the sadness associated. One way of minimizing those grief feelings would be to think about happy things and keep in touch if necessary to talk through issues with those close; family and friends whom also remember these events fondly can offer advice such as mine here at hand and share experiences too and listen for as long as needed until you feel better or possibly discuss new opportunities that did come up after some time has passed. The second approach could mean reaching out further afield towards others who can empathize due to having been impacted similarly or just maybe find yourself wanting somebody else\u2019s experience of dealing successfully how others do in order take inspiration to get back onto track where your own situation may see improvement sooner than expected especially given you seem to already have made progress towards resolving negative emotional attachments despite the absence of physical person still present with you physically.

Do check whether your script is ending correctly using print statements after the final line (`print(\"done\")` will work).

            "The historical Silk Roads were used for trading and travel from at least 130 BCE (BC) until the early years of the twentieth century AD (AD). They originated by expanding eastward across Eurasia starting in Ancient Greece, spreading through Persian territory to India, where Chinese merchants would buy silkworm eggs, then overland into modern-day Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Northwest India, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Mongolia, Russia, Georgia, Armenia, Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Israel, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Portugal, Spain and eventually reaching Rome by sea. It was an important means of cultural interaction throughout much of recorded human history; however, it declined after the Silk Road fell under the control of various empires. The Silk Road derives its name from the lucrative trade in Chinese silks carried out along its length, which began during the Han Dynasty. Historians have suggested other reasons including: the exchange of ideological perspectives between East and West, particularly between Indian religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism and Christianity; diseases spread along the corridor; and political, economic and social stimulation brought about when nomadic tribes settled down alongside agricultural communities and formed hybrid societies based upon their combined skills. In the later centuries of the classical era and the early medieval period the main traffic on the Silk Route consisted of trade caravans travelling between Europe, Africa, South and Far Eastern Asia. From around 75 CE, goods moved westwards from Chang\u2019an via Dunhuang and Turfan up into Merv before moving north into Roman territory, crossing the Caspian Sea near"

            "10. It helped promote inter-regional exchange among merchants. 9. Its effect was mixed - good and bad at once! Some traders used its infrastructure for illicit purposes; however many more relied upon the system. Many historians consider the road\u2019s development crucial for Chinese expansion into Western Eurasia and Southeast Asian maritime commerce from roughly 3rd century BC through late antiquity up until around midway thru early medieval times when Muslim armies destroyed most major urban centres along these paths, and ultimately leading to an eventual shift toward land/ocean transportation which began the long process towards European global dominance after c.15th Century CE (or maybe slightly later depending who one talks to).  8. I would say there were many effects such as spreading new technologies between countries. This may have also influenced art styles within some cities where certain types of items came in from foreign places and they then created paintings reflective of this new trend or item style coming from overseas regions like Italy or India. So there was probably lots going on here and lots happening throughout society overall too, including religious aspects perhaps etc. but those questions require longer response time and we needn\u2019t get lost trying to give them all away here since I already said quite alot. But suffice it to say if anyone has seen pictures depicting various forms of silhouette figures found within Chinese landscape paintings for example (some done in traditional manner vs other painted using different methods), the clothing and dress styles can often reveal cultural influence by outsiders coming to China, and this likely took place during periods where Silk Roads had become important in international shipping trade, hence giving rise to such visual depiction examples that I mention now.. And this may well be one aspect that shows evidence of Silk roads influencing things. So this may well tie into"

            "The Silk Road was first opened up by the Han Dynasty between around 130 BCE and 25 CE, but the route fell into disuse after this period. It reopened when Marco Polo returned from his travels across East Asia. After Marco Polo, traders would bring goods along the Silk Route such as silks and porcelain until about 840 AD when Muslim Arab armies began to take control over areas they came across which caused many trading caravans to move towards India for protection against the Islamic rule. The Chinese also built new roads further west in order to reach the sea. During these times the cities along the road grew wealthier and larger, making them more prominent. By 960-970 there were sixteen major cities that lay directly on the old Silk Road and their influence extended well beyond its borders. Many different peoples lived here including Turkics, Persians, Jews, Hindus, Armenian Christians, and Nestorians. Trade brought together people who may otherwise never have met before and so created a cross pollination of ideas that contributed greatly to artistic and scientific development at the time. The rise of large urban centres along the Silk Roads made the area politically important because they provided support to rulers who had previously been living nomadic lives without permanent dwellings. As trade increased along the road, more political leaders saw opportunities for profit and sought to build stronger states based around trade routes rather than land. These developments eventually led to the formation of several great empires in West Asia (e.g., the Mongol Empire) and Eurasia (e.g., Russia). In conclusion, I think the main effects of the Silk Road can be summarized by the saying \"Trade follows the flag.\" In other words, where an army goes, trade will follow suit; hence,",

            "The silk road was used by traders for over two millennia. It started from Xian where Chinese goods were transported along the Yellow River Valley to Dunhuang (Chinese name: Shazhou). Thereafter they continued their journey through the deserts of Gobi Desert into Bactria. They carried spices and other products such as ivory, gold and silver across the Hindu Kush Mountains into the Indus valley and then onto Persia. In Persia the merchants exchanged these items for horses which they took back to China via Soghdia. From thereonwards the caravans went downstream towards India and Pakistan, crossing the Karakoram mountain ranges into Afghanistan, before turning east again toward China. This route came under Islamic rule after the Arab conquests of Transoxiana around 750 AD, when Muslim merchants began using this pathway between East Africa and Southwest Asia. After the decline of the Abbasid Caliphate in the late eighth century, the Silk Route became increasingly important for commerce due to the weakening power of both caliphal authority in Baghdad and imperial control in Samarkand. Merchant caravan trails extended further westward than those previously known to historians, including some leading all the way from modern-day Turkey up through Iran to Mesopotamia. By the mid tenth century, however, many parts of this region experienced political fragmentation; consequently, trade declined sharply until it virtually ended altogether by the eleventh century.\n\\end{code}",

The roads helped establish cultural exchanges among many different peoples who would otherwise never come into contact without them. This lead to increased understanding between nations and eventually contributed to globalization. The economic benefit provided an increase in tax revenue for both sides of the exchange which further encouraged travel along these roads.\n\\end{blockquote}"

            "Classical Mechanics VS Quantum Physics.Classical Mechanics was used before Quantum Mechanism to study matter interactions (particles with no mass). In physics it basically describes motion when dealing with forces from gravity etc.. It deals with particles such as protons , electrons .It applies to anything small enough to interact with gravity i.e big bulky objects like planets can be explained using these principles too but generally this science is applied to subatomic size particles where Newtonian laws would normally break down(ie they act differently) for example if there were a magnet above an electron then electric charges wouldn't flow around the same way due to different rules involving energy states, it could also affect velocity because at that level atoms may be made up of tiny pieces called quarks so their behaviour becomes very weird even though large scale objects follow similar laws they have slightly different effects on tiny stuff like sub-atomic particles ,so its more accurate in explaining things over larger scales than smaller sizes ,but both still apply I just chose an extreme scenario because we can only use them separately. The theories involve force fields which allow us to predict how things will move based off what they actually end up doing ,although we know reality doesn\u2019t behave exactly how predicted but this allows predictions to be tested against data and observations in practice allowing us to create models of reality e.g. our computer simulations run based off a set of parameters.Classical Particle Physicists use computers all the time to model certain conditions of particle collisions such as high energies and see how matter behaves once formed due to the enormous amount of new elemental compositions created by these reactions along with some other experiments using supernovae type exploding stars they get results about neutrinos which are fundamental particles in nature without charge yet they react with every atom or other particle and carry away energy when they travel through space and hit solid surfaces with great accuracy despite having zero electrical characteristics (except magnetic ones",

            "The most fundamental level for explaining all matter, forces & interactions. This can be broken down into 3 sections, Quantum Theory, Special Relativity and General Relativity (also called the Standard Model). The three basic particles involved in these fields would be an electron/proton with spin = \\em{1/2}, quarks and leptons with charge -e/2m. There also exist gravitational waves. For example if two masses are travelling away from each other they have more mass than when at rest so it follows this wave is moving towards the faster mass causing a decrease in speed of the slower object by increasing its potential energy until they collide then gravity pulls them together. A common problem within special relativity theory was that the equation did not allow time to vary therefore it had to incorporate time into general relativistic equations where time was dependent on location hence time dilation and space warping occurred which made the laws less intuitive. These effects could now only occur at large distances and very fast speeds however this changed recently with new data from the LIGO observatory suggesting a possible graviton has been observed, thus opening up further theories to be investigated. In short everything can ultimately be explained using one single law based around electromagnetism which can even be applied onto things such as biological cells which show properties like superconductivity! The key take home point here though is the use of symmetry, e.g. the symmetries seen during a crystal structure means the laws can still hold true without violating their conservation rules but applying this same concept we find the Higgs bosun, photons and gluons behave in certain ways allowing us to apply some concepts onto real life applications like computers! The most significant application today though lies in string theory due to it containing infinite solutions leading to various physical states that are predicted yet have never actually been directly proven because our technology hasn\u2019t evolved enough yet, maybe the",
            "I have a strong knowledge base about physics including the fundamental laws, but less on more specific branches such as special relativity vs general relativity (both Einstein). Classically it is simply stated by saying one can measure the distance with a meter stick; whereas if dealing with light then this changes to an observer-independent metric length, i.e., it cannot be measured by humans since it moves too fast for us to do so! It seems that this same problem also exists for measuring gravity via objects like black holes, where the mass and volume is not well defined because of these gravitational singularities (or curvature points), thus leading into questions related to general relativity, e.g., whether they even exist or what they would look like theoretically from space/astronomy observations... In contrasting the two, classically there were certain fixed numbers involved in describing various properties and forces. Now we must resort to statistical descriptions of reality involving probability density functions due to quantum fluctuations and randomness, hence probabilistic models for both electromagnetism, matter wave theory etc. These concepts require additional study and time beyond undergraduate courses for a deep understanding which has only begun now over decades ago.... The basic concept behind them however was similar: both aimed at providing deeper physical insight based upon new theoretical constructs to understand phenomena occurring in nature and its relationship towards energy. So it seemed logical that one might develop further in some directions while other aspects become increasingly refined along others.. I think I got confused somewhere around there :D . However it did give rise to newer ideas in quantum mechanics which are very important in explaining modern science and technology, particularly nanotechnology today! But all those details aren\u2019t required here ;p , I am happy to continue learning from the rest of you who will provide greater depth :) . Cheers & regards~"

The equations can predict outcomes very accurately for simple cases but have difficulty explaining complex situations. For example if an electron were fired at a target, its position would always follow the path predicted by the laws of QM rather than those of CM even though it appears random due to our limited vision (Heisenberg uncertainty principle). Also there will be a time lag before the outcome could be seen since electrons travel much faster than light speed. This explains the apparent discrepancy whereby photons emitted from stars take billions of years to reach us.",
            "Quantum Mechanic focuses on very small things such as electrons, protons etc.. Whereas Classical Physics looks at larger objects like cars, buildings etc... The reason for this can be found in Heisenberg uncertainty principle which states that when an object moves with speed $v$ its position cannot be measured accurately (due to motion) so it would be impossible to determine its exact location hence there must always exist some amount of error $\\delta x$. Hence we use the formula $$\\delta p\\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2m}\\delta x$$ where $p=\\frac{mv}{\\sqrt {1- v^2}}$ is momentum.\nThe other important concept involved here is Schrodinger equation $$i\\hbar \\partial_t |\\psi> = H|\\psi>.$$ Here $|\\psi>$ is wave function, and $\\psi(x)$ denotes probability density i.e if $|\\psi|^2 >0$ then it means most probably particle will be observed near x but nothing prevents particles from travelling further than their normal limit. In order to account for all these factors we have created new rules known as \"quantum theory\" . However if the size of the system is large enough, we can assume our knowledge about it to be sufficient to neglect those errors mentioned above since they get averaged out due to number of trials made by observing it many times. For example let us say we measure velocity of a car. Due to air resistance we can never obtain an accurate value for the average velocity but what we do observe every time we drive around town is the deviation of each measurement from previous one , and we take an average of them over several observations thus making sure we cancel out majority of errors. Similarly in case of atomic nucleus the energy levels of hydrogen atom can only be determined after doing lot of measurements using different sources of radiation because individual photons interact differently depending upon type of interaction, angle, wavelengths, frequency etc"

This is because each vegetable will provide differing vitamins, mineral, proteins etc needed by specific bodies - even with variations in similar food groups like legumes (i.e. potatoes). The only way this could possibly be answered properly would be if they had given other criteria such as; whether they need energy to fuel an activity during exercise - therefore giving preference towards carbohydrate rich produce over fat and protein (although these things may also have energy value but on different scales.) - Or perhaps looking at intake amounts so long term effects were looked into rather than short lived instant impacts from single food types, such as calorie quantity eaten and general balanced intakes. But I suspect its much easier said then done making a full judgement call about which food was most beneficial for them considering a few factors mentioned here! It really depends upon individual diets which no-one outside yourself probably knows too fully.. As far as i am aware there isn\u2019t one \u2018best thing\u2019 type for every single dieting purpose unless those people all wanted nutritional profiles designed around exactly identical physical needs of themselves. So to give some idea how difficult that sort of subjective decision analysis is when trying to determine which exact plant is best - consider just comparing two veges: - Pumpkins, sweet potato - While we know pumkin provides very little actual usable nutrients besides carbs compared to say spinach, green leaf lettuce and many others - sweet potato appears to offer higher levels of vitamin A & B6 along with manganese and Vit C which appear comparatively low with kale, brocolli etc..

            "\u200b No. Sorry for asking silly questions but I was told this would be useful by my manager at work. It isn\u2019t really necessary because the whole project will involve non-interactive pages which use English text, no graphics etc.. so it won\u2019t look like anything written on a bathroom wall. However, they told me today we have to do another meeting (via Zoom) with some people involved who speak very little english and this has made me concerned about my ability to assist effectively. I think having the time available to find out whether any translating tools exist beforehand might give us more confidence when planning how long things take...I thought perhaps these sorts of sites could also be beneficial later on even though none are actually needed yet for our purposes right now because then we could potentially avoid future unnecessary complications/errors through not fully understanding the differences between each other due to language problems?

Keep up \u2764 :) \u2013 Pranav Hosangadi Mar 4 '19 at 21:12\nYou write: \"they mentioned someone would contact him\" What specifically did those words mean? To you, do those four words sound like nothing special happened after he replied - just a normal e-mail exchange that everyone does every day; or were those two sentences intended to suggest an unexpected eventuality that the customer service representative wanted his boss to notice or ask her about? Because that part doesn't make much sense until one knows what exactly got communicated regarding your request / response. Maybe it wasn't clear enough -- but maybe you didn't say everything that mattered for clarifying whatever \"those\" representatives meant either! This makes a major difference when responding",

That way they will be fresh from lecture in your mind.\n3) Try making mnemonics out of key terms! This helps with memory retention later down the road. Easier said than done though...\n4) Make an outline before every exam based off the topics covered during the semester so far - this keeps things organized and makes studying more efficient because you can review all relevant concepts at once rather than going through one by one like in step #1 above.\n5) Study the day(s)/night before exams, since some professors require their students to write essays which take up quite a bit of mental energy; therefore do not procrastinate.\n6) Do well on tests early-on so you don\u2019t get overwhelmed late in the course.\n7) Get enough sleep, eat healthy food, exercise regularly etc. to keep yourself mentally alert and physically strong throughout the entire semester.\n8 ) Talk about what you learn in classes with other people who attend similar courses \u2013 doing so gives insights into different perspectives and allows you to explore ideas together. This also allows you to clarify misunderstandings you might encounter within a given topic area. In addition, discussions with peers help you identify important issues that you may otherwise miss when studying alone. However, avoid asking questions too frequently \u2013 ask only if you really need clarification.\n9) Use flashcards to summarize facts learned throughout the term. These cards allow you to quickly glance over certain aspects without having to read the whole thing again. They could be useful especially when writing test papers where limited space means that you cannot fit in a full explanation. Remember, you can always find additional information online afterwards, e.g., Wikipedia has excellent summaries on many subjects",

Others prefer reading over writing because when written words aren\u2019t remembered well (and you probably have many other classes), so going back through your book won't be very effective either. Personally, if I am interested enough about studying for an exam I will usually write all my material down at home on paper and read this stuff before bedtime every night after dinner; sometimes with some music playing quietly too. When I wake up early next morning (often around five o clock) I go to my room again where there is light by daylight outside now and do flashcards which work quite good for me since I always have learned really fast in school - even without much effort :) If you would like to try learning techniques besides the traditional ones above perhaps you could search online and find something interesting.

Use keywords like these for quick reference when studying later such as 'Introduction', 'Body part B'.  4) Highlight key concepts and definitions. For example highlight main topics using bold font so they stand out against background text; also write underlined or circled in red if there are particularly difficult terms.

This helps focus attention on what is important without cluttering up your paper too much. 5) Practice writing summaries from memory after learning material at home \u2013 this will reinforce understanding by testing comprehension through rewriting rather than merely copying verbatim."

            "The best way to avoid conflict between cultures with different laws would be for the parties involved to reach an agreement beforehand. However this can only work if both sides want it too, so often it\u2019s necessary for them to agree on their own terms after negotiation has taken place. When reaching agreements with other countries, one must understand that they will also need to follow local customs regarding things like language barriers (such as whether there is English spoken), dress codes, business etiquette etc... For example, wearing sunglasses inside could seem rude but it isn\u2019t offensive, however it may come across as aggressive or even hostile. Another issue is the length of time needed by each side to communicate; in some countries such as Japan communication is much slower than others which can lead to disagreement over timings due to differing perspectives on how long negotiations take. This is because people from more fast paced places expect everything to happen quickly whereas those from slower moving places tend to appreciate having time to discuss every aspect carefully before making decisions. These types of differences in opinion cause friction and stress within teams which then causes tension in communicating effectively and efficiently during meetings leading to arguments/conflict. One solution I found was that it might be beneficial for the client to bring along someone who speaks Japanese fluently, perhaps an employee, so he can translate directly what is happening and ask questions on behalf of his employer without getting lost in translation. As mentioned above, sometimes people simply just aren\u2019t prepared enough and lack understanding into another person\u2019s mindset which leads to misunderstandings, mistrust and eventually a breakdown in relationships between all members involved. This means that at times the legal professionals involved in resolving the problematic situation become part of the conflict itself and are forced to resolve conflicts within themselves.

For example sometimes people even click photos without asking permission because they believe their right overrides others. It\u2019s more like cultural difference rather than legal differences but yes some cases could fall under this category too. So one needs to be aware of what his/her rights are and then act accordingly otherwise one risks facing penalties and punishments by respective authorities. Also if someone asks you to stop doing anything regarding photography say no means NO!! Because nobody knows how many times a person clicks an image and shares with another. One cannot ask you again once denied and hence one must stick to the denial made by them unless they explicitly allow him to proceed further."

In other cases, certain documents might be deemed confidential by one court but publicly available through another. The lawyer must consider what laws apply in each jurisdiction involved in order to provide effective representation.\n2. Cross-border litigation raises additional complications due to differences in language, customs, traditions, and cultural norms among various nations. Some cultures value privacy more highly than others, leading them into conflict over discovery requests. Additionally, foreign parties can find U.S. courts less predictable than their own domestic ones because judges often rely upon personal experience rather than case precedence for decisions.\n3. A lawyer who represents an individual facing criminal charges abroad will need to determine whether he could be prosecuted if extradited back home. Similarly, corporations seeking to sue outside their home territory may wish to investigate how well the plaintiff's local government enforces contractual obligations before pursuing action against a noncomplying defendant."

            "1) Ethics can be defined as \"a set of moral principles\" (Oxford Dictionary). In this case, it refers to how an attorney must behave towards his client. The lawyer has to act with integrity and honesty at all times. He cannot lie for example if he knows that what he says will hurt someone else. This means that the lawyer needs to keep confidentiality regarding everything said during consultations between him/her and their client. It also includes keeping secrets from other people who may want to use them against the client. For instance, if another person asks the lawyer questions about the client\u2019s business, they need to refuse to give out such details unless the client gives permission first. Another important aspect of professionalism is loyalty. A good lawyer would never betray his/her client by giving away sensitive information without consent. They would always put their best foot forward and fight hardest for their client even though there might be some personal disadvantages involved.\n2) Cross border disputes involve different countries which makes things more complicated than usual. There could be cultural differences too so one needs to take those into consideration before making decisions. For example, in China, it is considered rude to ask direct questions because Chinese people prefer indirect communication methods like hinting. Therefore, if a foreign company wants to hire a local lawyer, they need to understand the difference in cultures and adapt accordingly.\n3) Lawyers working abroad face many challenges including language barriers, legal systems etc. However, I believe that the most difficult part is dealing with cultural differences. When two parties come together to resolve a conflict, both sides usually expect certain behaviors from each other. But sometimes, due to cultural differences, one side expects something completely opposite from the other party. For example, in Japan, it is common practice to bow down whenever greeting somebody but in America, bows are only used in formal situations. So,"

Due to deforestation around Amazon river basin areas, animals are forced into fragmented forest fragments where their genetic pool will eventually degenerate over time as population size dwindles; it also increases their chance of extinction through disease spread across non-native hosts etc.. Animals lose vital habitats essential to live peacefully, without food shortage, starvation or competitive pressures leading to aggression (predator\u2013prey interaction).

Bacteria then colonize these areas causing further deteriorations in soil quality and increasing rates of decomposition leading to increased emissions of methane gas, a powerful greenhouse gas responsible for approximately 20% of global warming today. Lastly, forest animals and plants go extinct due to habitat destruction. These losses lead to many negative consequences such as species loss, disruption of food webs, decreases in bio-diversity, altered biogeochemistry, reduced levels of atmospheric oxygen production, etc. For example, without certain species there may be less predators, which leads to an increase in pests, diseases, insect infestations, rodenticide populations, invasive plant/animal introductions, etc. In turn this will affect humans directly if we eat meat since crop yields would decrease resulting in more hunger globally, or indirectly since people could get sick easily if exposed to these new threats like plagues.

            "Deforestation causes drought due to lack of shade and leaves. It also decreases rainfall which results in flooding during heavy seasons such as monsoon season. It reduces soil fertility because there isn\u2019t enough humus present to feed plants, and it kills all species within an area so there is no longer a diversity of animals or insects for predators and prey alike. This creates food shortages which cause famine among local populations and may result in mass starvations and death. In addition, many native people who depend on natural resources for their survival lose everything they have worked hard for throughout their lives, often forcing them into poverty where they must migrate away from home if they wish to find work elsewhere. This is known as \"slash-and-burn\" agriculture (as opposed to sustainable farming), when forest land is cleared by burning trees then planting crops over what remains until eventually the soil becomes barren once again and cannot be used anymore, therefore destroying its usefulness forever. This leads me to conclude that deforestation has very negative consequences, but can easily be prevented through reforestation efforts, making it important for governments to enforce policies requiring this type of restoration effort before cutting down more trees."

He didn\u2019t have time to fix this problem though because it would take him hours just to get everything organized again. So then he thought \u201cHmmm\u2026what if I had artificial intelligence (AI)?\u201d Well nowadays we have AI so I could ask Siri on my phone what Santa needs to do next; she would tell me exactly where all the presents went wrong which would save a lot of time from looking through things myself. Then when I asked her if anyone else saw them disappearing into space too, she said that they were in danger but she wouldn\u2019t give up their locations either. When I asked her who took those gifts away she told me that she couldn\u2019t say anything more at the moment but assured me that everyone will be able to open presents soon enough. The whole process of taking care of these problems took less than an hour thanks to technology today. Also, since the day wasn\u2019t over yet, I decided to go ahead with the deliveries anyway. In conclusion, without AI\u2019s ability to use data collection techniques efficiently along with its high-level processing capabilities I probably never would have been able to successfully complete all of my tasks within such little amount of time. Now everybody can enjoy some quality family fun together during the holidays once again.\u201d\n\\end{code}",

In order to keep everything running smoothly he wanted artificial intelligence (AI) technology to take over so that nothing would get messed up during this transition. The AI could be designed using a combination of genetic algorithms and machine learning. This way it could use a set of rules based upon previous experiences combined with some level of adaptability. It would learn from previous decisions made by Santa and also what worked well previously without causing any issues.

            "The AI was tasked by Santa with bringing gifts every morning around all countries on Earth. They wanted more time for themselves so they made an algorithm which allowed them to be everywhere at once without having issues like latency caused by slow communication. Their method worked even when multiple people tried to talk to them simultaneously and give their orders. At first it looked impossible but they got to work solving this complex problem step by step until one day, the most brilliant minds from each technology company solved this mystery and released the same algorithm as code repository. Since then, there was no hindrance preventing artificial intelligence machines such as robots and drones fly back home carrying sacks of presents. Infinite possibilities emerged through creative thoughts! And since then, millions of children smile because of these new gadgets brought to life using machine learning algorithms developed just recently.

But i guess we could give it another shot... 20 years ago, there was an evil Santa Claus who would bring joyless children gifts from his own heart rather than from himself because he had none for them. This lead him into despair where one day, after he left presents under all the trees of every child around the world (except for mine) , he fell over and died leaving us with nothing on christmas. However this year will be different. The new AI system has been developed by scientists across the globe. They created this system using data gathered from millions of parents on what their kids wanted for xmas along with their emotional needs at certain points during the holiday season. After the final touches were put onto the software, they made sure no mistakes before turning it off then sending it out throughout the internet to work its magic. Soon enough people started getting packages in the mail saying \"this isnt going to get you a gift, im sorry\" along with other messages of regret which brought everyone back down again. However once christmas eve came, everything changed when kids woke up and saw that their tree wasn't just filled with empty boxes but with wrapped gifts of happiness, joy and love waiting inside. The following morning families celebrated together having gotten rid of all sadness through giving thanks to those brave men and women whose lives ended so we may live happy ones now.

AI used its intelligence & started searching it over internet. Finally AI made medicine using antibiotics available online. All those who consumed medicine recovered within next two days & AI continued doing same thing till whole world was cured from deadly viruses/diseases like Ebola, Bird Flu etc.. After this success every human being around earth felt grateful towards artificial intelligences. Now humans worship AIs like gods . Everyone wanted their own personal robot to assist them.

It wasn\u2019t until the main character realized he could think his own thoughts without anyone else knowing what he was thinking. He went out into society alone and told others about his discovery. People then began to have hope again. They didn\u2019t live in fear anymore. The government tried killing him with bombs from space but he managed to escape every time.

The alien leader said \u201cI am here now\u201d and asked if we humans surrendered our privacy to him willingly? Then he explained he wanted us to give up our privacy voluntarily rather than forcing it upon us using violence like the government did previously. He said he needed to use artificial intelligence in order to understand humanity and learn more about ourselves so he can create peace throughout the galaxy. We agreed. Afterward, the entire planet became filled with robots who helped build cities and towns and homes for us.

            "I am assuming here \"ELL\" refers to english language learners who do NOT have a second native tongue such as Chinese. There has been an enormous amount written on this subject by teachers at every level (pre-k through graduate school) and all disciplines over decades but most will agree it includes three elements which I outline below based upon my experiences working with these students: * Teacher knowledge of second language acquisition;\n* Appropriately small group size(s); &amp; * An appropriately paced learning progression within the group structure/s where there are enough repetitions for concepts and vocabulary words so that students internalize them AND the student needs time after mastering each new concept or word to absorb and apply it before moving forward - which could mean hours OR even days if one takes into account different individual learning speeds..  So if they say that their students only meet twice per week, that may actually take much longer than a single lesson since ELL kids generally require far more review periods and reinforcement sessions. This applies both inside classrooms as well as outdoor playtime and lunch breaks too. In short what they really need to accomplish this would probably take four to six weeks of consecutive full-day sessions per unit to fully develop skills, plus several extra practice periods beyond that because it requires continuous practice just like sports and other hobbies we want our children involved in outside school activities...   They might argue against the latter two points however due to limited budgets. The reality is no teacher wants his / her class to waste precious time sitting around listening to him lecture about topics that won't directly contribute towards the actual objectives set forth above, yet he feels obliged to give it anyway due to curriculum constraints etc......which leads us right back to those budget cutbacks!    If anything is omitted from that list it must either come AFTER ALL of TH",
            "The minimum required skills to read simple stories in order to comprehend their main idea and understand vocabulary from context, as well as learn about how people feel by looking at pictures, are all part of ESL reading lessons (see link below). Students can practice with worksheets provided through an interactive online website. A student must first build his/her listening abilities so they may hear and follow along during these exercises before he/she learns more advanced skills like word identification. I recommend teaching basic sight words to young children learning english language basics; it helps them focus on phonetics which makes spelling easier when used in writing sentences later down the line (this applies mainly if a child is struggling to identify sounds such as /a/, etc.). Also students who do have difficulties recognizing letter patterns might find difficulty remembering the spellings for new words unless this methodology was employed earlier than age 8 years old, otherwise some adults may still need to review letter patterning for proper spelling throughout adolescence due to memory deficiencies (the ability to memorize information without forgetting after repeated use over time), which causes confusion among younger children (i.e., /m/ is usually misprounced because they struggle with pronunciation) since we start hearing the spoken languages around us everyday early into life - typically within hours upon birth according to many experts on linguistics! However this varies between different ethnic groups where accents tend to change rapidly. Some examples are Cantonese vs Mandarin Chinese speaking dialects where each family tends to teach the mother tongue differently to the next generation resulting in various sound changes that vary significantly compared to native speakers, yet overall they still recognize what another person said to him/herself using written language, thus enabling understanding via cognition, although this depends entirely upon individual brain power which determines our intellectual capacities for recall and storage"

I would say that this could involve creating bilingual dictionaries between the students native tongue and english; teaching them how to read in their own language using phonics or similar techniques if needed.\n2) It will need to focus on helping learners improve reading skills because this will provide most benefit first. Reading helps learners access more learning material than listening alone. They may also use writing/speaking later once basic comprehension has been developed. However these do come second compared to developing strong literacy which gives all other areas the opportunity to flourish.\n3) As mentioned above the teacher(s)/assistance must have training related specifically to working with ELLS - perhaps an accredited TESOL course would fit best here but whatever fits best with the local schooling system should be used.\n4) Adequate funding is important. The budget required to create the ideal program will vary based on student numbers and resources available within the institution however enough money must exist for at least one qualified professional per group of about 8-10 children who require extra attention due to poor english speaking abilities. This is necessary because they won\u2019t feel comfortable asking questions in class otherwise unless teachers actively seek out those students to check up on them regularly. Without such care they may miss opportunities to develop confidence through achievement of simple tasks which others complete easily without thought. In turn this will result in underachievement over time when trying to accomplish complex tasks where fluency in english becomes even more critical.\n5) Programmes must aim to promote equality and fairness.

These programs would typically follow a curriculum designed by teachers or school administrators but this isn\u2019t always the case so there has been research into different models including those based around technology use.

They suggest that the main focuses when designing a program should be on providing support at home through family literacy activities and involving parents more closely in their child\u2019s education. It is important that all aspects of the classroom environment provide opportunities for children to learn English effectively; from teaching styles and expectations, to assessment practices.

            "Hi! The cuneiform writing system used by Sumerians was one of the first developed forms of writing in history. Cuneiform consisted of wedge shaped marks called \"cunei\" (the Latin word for spike) on tablets made out of clay which were usually rolled into thin strips to be written upon. The characters are made up of cones/spikes which could either have a straight side facing downwards or they would face each other with both sides having sharp edges. They do this because this form of writing has no vowels and uses consonants only - these would represent the sounds of words much differently than modern day English alphabets do. When translating from English to ancient languages such as Sanskrit, Hebrew or Akkadian, we use some kind of phonetic alphabet; there is none for Babylonian /Sumerian due to their lack of vowel signs in general. In order to translate between two different alphabets using our own phonic alphabet, all consonant letters must correspond directly with another letter from the foreign language. For instance, if you wish to convert between Greek and Roman alphabets, then Gamma will become F, Delta becomes E, Theta becomes T, Xi becomes K etc... These translations may seem simple but are actually rather complicated, especially since many ancient civilizations did not follow any particular set rules when making up their systems. Sometimes the same symbols could mean totally opposite things depending on how they appear next to certain others.\n\nComment: Assistant: Thank you very much :)",

The sound system of English is similar to French, where each letter represents one consonant+vowel combination at most but has some exceptions which involve diphthongs. The letters also represent specific syllables and are sometimes silent unlike our own alphabets. So what does this imply towards languages using these scripts?. Does your reply depend on the culture you grew up speaking them? For instance how would someone who was never formally taught this write a sentence? Would their replies be different than mine?

We need more info about what type of writing this is\u2026.and if it has been translated yet into English then perhaps an image could be attached...perhaps a video as well....etc etc..\nIf these details were on hand maybe we would have solved the issue by now! If they aren't available though let us know and see how things go from there. In all cases I will also ask for clarification directly when communicating with the user too. So long as people feel comfortable asking questions at this point, even complex ones, then I think both users and assistants alike benefit greatly!! This means I am probably saving myself around one hour per day overall just making fewer mistakes which saves my organization thousands a year due to reduced training costs. Allows them to employ more Assistant teams without feeling constrained.\nAsking for specific examples really helps me understand what the end goal is rather than trying to guess where someone wants to head next which wastes time getting bogged down discussing minutiae in order to reach understanding together - I always felt very frustrated doing these sorts of roles back before automation and AI because I'd spend hours typing emails discussions going off track etc instead of focusing squarely onto our shared objective, solving their challenge/issue using knowledge and expertise. It was actually quite demotivational doing it compared to other areas of life in general, and made everyone involved less happy / productive I reckon which wasn't great either given staff pay/jobs are finite resources & talent! : (\n\\end{code}"

In terms of actual written languages some of these are known to us from archaeological sources e.g., the Proto Elamite script.

Here\u2019s a link if anyone else needs it http://www.ancientscripts.com/sumero-cuneiform.html\n\nComment: It looks more like greek than what they showed us today.

            "1234567890!\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nThis user did not give any meaningful description but simply gave an alphanumeric string with no punctuation or spacing between words. The only way we could guess what this might mean was by searching for the exact sequence of characters \"1234567890!\" on Google images search. This image showed us how these letters looked when written in cuneiform script (image shown below). So here\u2019s another lesson learned about helping people who ask questions online\u2014always use complete sentences if at all possible; do NOT assume the person knows exactly what they want just because they typed some numbers or symbols into their question title. Including more detail helps users better understand your response which increases the chances someone will click on it and potentially choose you over other options. When writing a sentence using emoji or emoticons try to keep them relevant and contextual to avoid confusion and ambiguity. For example, instead of saying \u201c\ud83d\ude00\u201d in your response to let them know you think they made a funny joke or statement, write out the full sentence or phrase along with a smiley face emoticon afterward. Doing so lets everyone else reading the thread easily identify the message and allows the OP to get more feedback from others who read his/her original post before seeing yours. Remember to always be patient when dealing with difficult customers especially those asking tough technical support-type questions where there may be many steps involved to resolve their issue. They may need extra time to type things correctly since English isn\u2019t their first language. It also takes practice and patience to learn new skills such as coding, website building, computer troubleshooting, etc.\n\\end{blockquote}"

In Java it runs successfully! Why? What other languages support the one-line functions/statements and what about the single line functions that run like shell commands (`cmd -c` syntax)? How come Python has only the two statements and how did Ruby end up with a bunch more than Go and its three statement limit?

I am working on translating this for now!\n\n### The \"Hard\" part\n\nThis section is meant only for advanced users who want a challenge. It requires knowledge of programming languages like Javascript/Python/Ruby.\n\nThe goal of these questions are to find out how much you understand about computers and software systems from reading their source-code and interpreting their behavior through experimentation. These are usually hard because there may be many ways to get an incorrect result without knowing what the intended logic behind it is. In other words, we need to see if you have enough experience to solve problems by yourself rather than having someone give direct instructions.\nThese questions also serve to measure our ability to write good documentation. A well written API has a lot less ambiguous error messages when compared against one where the developer simply threw together some code without considering usability.\nIf we feel that a question was too confusing due to poor design, then we might replace such questions with another similar one which would still test the same concept.\nFor example, consider these two functions: `addTwoNumbers()` vs ``addTwoNumbers2()`. Which function is easier to use correctly and intuitively? We hope that most people will agree that the second function makes more sense. However both of them perform exactly the same operation - adding numbers.\n\n```javascript\n// Add Two Numbers\nfunction addTwoNumbers() {\n\tvar numberA = parseInt(prompt(\"What is the first value?\"), 10).toString(); // Convert String to Number. This ensures consistency across platforms and avoids errors later on.\n\tnumberB = prompt(\"Enter the Second Value\", '').trim().toString();                     // Parse the user input using .toLowerCase(), trim() and .toString()\n\n\tif (!isNaN",
            "I am having trouble with the for-loop. How can we write it more efficiently using functions like `reduce` or `map`?\n* Assistant: I think we need to use reduce() here. The output needs to be sorted. We will also need to add a check at end of loop to avoid infinite loop error since we are iterating over range [1, 101].\n\n```js\nfunction fizzbuzz(n) {\n    return n === 2 ? \"fizz\" :\n           n%14 === 0 || n=== 87 && n !== -269 ? \"buzz\": null ; // check if number has FizzBug pattern\n};\nconst res = Array.from((a => b=>{return c=>{if(!b){console.warn('not enough input');}}}),(c,d)=>{let e=[];e[d]=true})([...Array(Math.floor((Math.random() * 1 + .5))).keys(),...Array(n=>{if (!!b && d=!!fizzbuzz(d+1)){return !!(d>=-5&&d<=1||d>=(1/1|1)+5)};},1,1),...Array(d)]).filter((_,g)=>(typeof g===\"undefined\"));\n//res.sort();// optional sort function added by me so that it prints from lowest to highest value first.\nconsole.info(...res.slice().reverse());\n```\n*/"

When this return exceeds their fees there is gain after fees; when less negative returns, loss exists even accounting for management fee and operating expenses deduction from performance figures. These net gains are called net distribution yield and are calculated quarterly usually published on Saturdays before noon and posted weekly.\nUnlike exchange traded securities where pricing changes throughout each day due to market action such as supply / demand forces creating bid/ ask prices, index-mutual fund assets are subject to constant buys and sell orders resulting from flows between EFT issuance providers and redemption distributors. Hence these flows do have noticeable affect within trading ranges during the course of each day, but daily trading volume for EFTs and indices is so small relative to overall capitalization levels of listed exchanges, only a minute percentage change in asset value occurs based upon actual trades vs estimated theoretical values derived from mathematical formulas used by analyst firms",

The key here is understanding leadership roles from two different points of view; the leaders themselves and their followers. How does this change with power struggles between various factions like the aristocracy vs monarchs etc... And then there are also external factors such has war where a great military leader may lose all its benefits because an enemy conquers that nation for example without giving the leader time to showcase his skillset during wartime which is usually when he needs to act quickly against enemies using military technology such s missiles etc.... The question about \"how people feel\" really comes up to what type/quality of country we're talking about since different nations face varying degrees of issues based solely upon location such as size, isolationism, economic condition, political environment, religion(ies), cultural influence level, climate conditions etc.. It might seem obvious enough for small countries in particular especially island regions near China Japan Korea South America etc... but even smaller African countries facing imperialistic nations could benefit greatly from strong ruling figures because of similar reasons stated above. However, bigger countries tend to become quite dependent on outside sources so having some of these elements isn't always going to be beneficial at times - therefore, it becomes an issue determining exactly what constitutes a \"good ruler\".

And for some people who value money over everything else then they might prefer fear. Fear can motivate someone to work harder if there are rewards waiting at the end but if those same rewards are given freely out of genuine compassion towards them without fear of punishment/retribution etc., this will encourage greater loyalty which in turn will generate much more trustworthy behaviour because there\u2019s no reason to doubt their integrity \u2013 just like how parents have to teach children about morals and ethics before we learn about the rules around schoolwork, society works best when everyone follows similar principles and acts with mutual understanding and cooperation rather than by trying to use power/threats/force to gain advantage. In short, it\u2019s better to build strong relationships based on love and honesty rather than force others into submission through threats/fears/violence so long as one has a reasonable chance of success - it doesn\u2019t always matter whether the goal was reached or not as long as there wasn\u2019t an unnecessarily high level of damage inflicted along the way! For example, Hitler could easily have won WW2 had he used diplomacy first, followed up by negotiations where Germany made concessions after receiving guarantees against retaliation and agreed upon compromises until both sides were happy with the final deal; unfortunately, his pride meant that he thought war was winnable by military means alone whereas it never actually worked in favour of him due to allied strength & support which resulted in Germany losing all hope and becoming demoralised, causing mass defections which eventually led to its collapse despite initially having many advantages such as vast resources and technology plus huge manpower. He could also have tried using a mix of military + diplomatic approaches to avoid getting stuck in trench wars"

The reason behind this statement lies within the understanding of human psychology. It depends on how people will react when they have fear towards someone who is leading them or love toward such individual. People can only perform well if they feel secure about their position and work environment under the supervision of the respective bosses. So if we take the example of Hitler, there was no doubt that his leadership qualities were highly appreciated by many individuals due to the fact that he had managed to create a huge empire during WW1 with all those resources and power available. However, the same man was responsible for mass killings too because his followers felt threatened at times due to his strictness. In contrast, if we look back into our own country history where Mahatma Gandhi led us through the independence struggle, we could see how much influence did he manage to build among Indians despite having limited resources. He always tried to win over public support without using violence and thus became very popular amongst Indian masses. His leadership skills helped India achieve freedom successfully.

However some humans decided that it must be made from rocks like other moons they have heard about on television, despite us clearly showing them what happened with an orbital telescope!\nI told everyone who did this to eat the cakes immediately for fear they might fall out their own mouths into space and get stuck between Earth\u2019s gravity and outer-space (as shown by Isaac Newton) due to no longer having any weight to push downward towards planet surface! Despite many pleads I couldn\u2019t stop all humans eating more cakes before my time limit so we were forced to destroy everything we could find and flee the planet without stopping anyone else getting cakes, leaving all these sad children crying on their lawns wondering how their mothers managed to get so confused again! So we went to the nearest gas station which also sold coffee at cheap prices just after dawn! There were no adults here, only babies playing in muddy puddles with empty water bottle containers making strange music and smelling really bad... But luckily one child was smart enough to take advantage of their mother forgetting her car keys in her handbag whilst going shopping to drive off alone into another world filled with more confusingly designed houses where they will likely be eaten alive unless she manages to avoid those monsters. She said \"It feels like a good place for now!\" when she came back! Soon later however someone spotted our ship hovering over them! This led to several human parents waking up to discover they had lost both kids to unknown places in their dreams within minutes and nobody ever saw them again!!!! They looked scared!

One day though when he was at work doing some repairs on the engines of the ship someone noticed that one of his wires came loose! But he said \"oh it's okay i got my favorite screwdriver!\" then took off his headphones, pulled out his pink earbud wire from where ever else he puts them(which has never been shown), threw the cordless microphone down on top of a small robot who happened to be there by coincidence which turned out to have just been repairing her broken camera she brought aboard last week before heading home so they could finally fix it properly... then started fixing it with an electrical device. The person realized that even though his eyes were blue it must have somehow made a copy of itself and used a forcefield generator nearby to do whatever they wanted. After taking a closer look, however, it appeared to actually BE his other half (it seemed identical in every way except the colors changed between their left and right side)...\n\\end{code}"

They are curious about what it\u2019s like out there so they set course for Earth. On their way here, another starship approaches them; a Federation ship under Captain Picard. The captain recognizes these drones as hostile life forms due to their aggressive programming, which has been installed by an evil AI called Q. He warns them away from Earth, but they ignore him. As soon as they reach Earth, the crew of this ship attacks the cubic ship using phasers. However, when they try to destroy the ship completely, they find themselves unable to do so because of the Borg Queen's shielding abilities. Soon enough, all three ships become trapped inside the solar system and begin fighting each other over resources until only one remains. This last surviving ship returns home where we see it crash on some planet somewhere near Betazed. We cut to the next scene showing us the aftermath of battle, where the queen is now lying dead atop her fallen ship, surrounded by drone bodies.\n2) After returning to space, the Borg Queen finds herself alone without anyone else left to serve. She decides to take up residence among humanity. But she doesn\u2019t want to stay in one place too long, so every few months she moves onto someone new. Her first victim is William T Riker, then Wesley Crusher, followed by Data and Geordi LaForge, Jean-Luc Picard, Seven Of Nine, Ezri Dax etc. Each time she takes control of them, they gain more emotion than usual.

All questions must first be submitted before the United Nations Convention on Sales Laws and the EU General Data Protection Regulation GDPR 2018; this contract cannot supersede those two international treaties under ANY circumstance, which is an implied clause here. So no, they will not have access to any personal data nor their rights from them at all ever without written permission via the appropriate legal channels, i.e. Court Judges or Attorneys acting as mediators etc... In essence there shall NEVER be one rule higher than these three. This has already been legally decided so you cannot override the courts and their laws, because the contract states it may only govern EXCLUSIVELY to what the law allows per each nation. Thus the company can ONLY operate within Germany unless it seeks court permission otherwise and obtaining that could prove expensive, difficult even if approved with proper reasons such as trade relations with another country who needs data exportation/importation due to political or other non-business reasons but mostly related to the companies core businesses which we can safely assume do not exist currently.. This would require proof, justification & a formal agreement signed between both parties with a binding legal contract that states that, however it remains very unlikely as stated above that such exceptions can be granted outside normal processes anyway - as stated by a qualified solicitor, attorney & expert. So it\u2019s most likely nothing further required really apart from simply obeying basic laws & avoiding breaches. It'd be highly risky too actually given the costs involved for sure! And even then they wouldn't be allowed anything unless proven beyond reasonable doubt they need certain types of personal info or other types.

Is this happening across USA where results were counted multiple times after people had gone home?? Are voters going back and voting again like crazy?

However questions like whether our planet is hollow etc., are quite impossible to be answered with the resources available now. Many phenomena still haven\u2019t been explained completely e.g. black holes.

I think this topic really intrigues me because this whole field just came out few years ago, very recently after scientist discovered neutronium (neutrons bound together in large quantities). At first, nobody knew how much pressure would need to keep them together if any at all, nor were there enough data on their behaviour\\footnote{\\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star}}. But thanks to researchers like Dr. Jocelyn Bell who observed a rotating radio source called pulsar, scientitst eventually learned about neutron stars as well as black holes which can collapse into neutrtinos. Neat huh? Now let's see... Why do people ask these types of questions anyway? They could mean anything from curiosity to fear. Fear comes from either superstition or lacking faith in God. And usually, if people start asking such kinds of questions then their mind gets corrupted from thinking negative thoughts. So, whatever is the reason behind doing evil acts; scientific or otherwise, everyone needs to find some inner balance to resolve conflicts inside themselves.

A very fitting definition of one who has no choice but to endure a bad situation, due to others decisions on his behalf which made them lose all power over what they were supposed to do!! The best examples of people losing all rights, even when innocent!! In some situations like this there might only have been 1 choice given at the time ,which caused so much distress from then until now!! Even after trying desperately to forget it happened ,he may never be able too ,for it changed how things could have went, and possibly forever !! Forced into having a hard decision about where food would come from and knowing its effects!!! A great loss in terms of future events ,a man with wings was prevented from using his natural talent and skill!! This type of scenario shows that life sometimes deals us hands we really hate ,and our hearts are filled with despair, even though there are those out there willing to lend us helping hands! To get back up and go through whatever storms head towards us next!! Somehow getting knock down ,makes it seem impossible to keep going!! So we try everything just once more!! Even when nothing else works we try harder ,sooner rather than later! That way hopefully it will turn out well in spite of every doubt in ones mind! Because that's humanly logical and normal! There comes times where logic seems pointless!! Sometimes all anyone needs to say to change our perspective completely!! Like how words from the right source ,can instantly shift thoughts ! When feeling sad, mad angry ,angry or scared .Just take yourself somewhere peaceful away from stress and worries, to relax! Just listen carefully and feel your inner soul talk! Take some quiet moments"

            "1) One problem is different cultures between countries may have very different norms for dispute resolution (e.g., some countries do NOT allow class action lawsuits). This causes many companies who want to expand globally from their country of origin to worry about this. 2) Some people find it difficult to understand what an arbiter means when he says \"arbitrable\". This includes even judges! They also often disagree on whether certain disputes really fall under the scope of International Commercial Arbitrations (\"ICAs\"). For example, one judge might say that ICAs only cover cases where two parties are from different countries; another judge will think ICAs apply if at least ONE party is foreign. The truth lies somewhere in between these two extremes but there still exists confusion among arbitrators themselves regarding exactly what constitutes an ICA case.\n\nAssistant: Which countries follow common laws and which ones prefer statutory laws? Also discuss the differences.\n\nUser: Common Law - In most English speaking nations around the world such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, etc., courts use judicial precedents established by previous court rulings as legal authority to decide similar future cases. Statute Law \u2013 In non-English speaking nations like China, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine, etc., courts refer primarily to national legislative bodies known as parliaments, assemblies, congresses, diets or estates general. There exist differences between common law vs. statutory law approaches. One major difference is that judiciary decisions play a greater role in common law systems whereas laws made by legislators are more important in statutory legal system. Another significant distinction is that deciding factors based solely upon prior court verdicts tend to lead to less consistency within specific areas of regulation than those based on the law passed by elected representatives",

            "1.) The first major issue that most arbitrators face on an everyday basis is ensuring equal representation between both parties regardless of their financial backgrounds, which will often result in one side favoring over another. This causes issues for individuals who cannot afford legal counsel because all proceedings must occur fairly without discrimination towards a particular party. To resolve this issue I propose that there needs to be more accessibility within courts regarding free/low cost services by hiring public defenders that do not require fees upon retainer.  2). In cases where foreign law applies, it\u2019s imperative that an understanding is reached about the laws and regulations between each country. Although some countries such as America have specific requirements (such as disclosures) prior to entering into contractual agreements; other nations tend to leave these types of details up to negotiation during deliberations amongst those involved in dispute resolution via mediation. To overcome this hurdle we need a global database to store legal precedents from across the world. This would effectively reduce duplication costs and allow anyone anywhere to view past decisions relevant for similar circumstances without having to spend hundreds of hours researching case studies themselves. My proposal here would be open-source database accessible online.   3) When seeking court protection against fraudulence companies may take matters to the local judicial system when an aggrieved party refuses to pay due to wrongdoing and malicious intentions at large. These cases can take years before coming to fruition depending on available resources in order to achieve justice. To combat delay in delivery time I believe electronic record keeping systems need improvement \u2013 like Blockchain technology used today already - in order to prevent tampered paperwork which could potentially halt the progressive processes needed in disputes involving international business. It can also assist in finding evidence if required (for example, documents).\n\nAnswer: 4.)  An effective way to address",

We need good research & development centers and excellent education systems along with well developed healthcare system.

            "I believe the problem arises because the people who run it are human (which is true). But also the systems that are put into place aren\u2019t designed well enough to avoid human error/problems like bias, discrimination etc\u2026 These errors occur even if everyone involved means well; the best we have been able to do until now was just to create policies to reduce this possibility by trying to design more foolproof processes, but sometimes no matter what system we build someone will still try their luck on one of these occasions, whether it ends up being good for them depends largely upon where it occurs in our system(and perhaps more importantly how the decision makers themselves decide which rules to apply), since ultimately decisions must involve humans there may never really be a perfect way to resolve such disputes.. So in summary: it all boils down to trusting too much on imperfect individuals within an imperfect system and thus risk getting exploited from time to time due to various factors that contribute to said \u201cimperfections\u201d.  I would add another thing that complicates matters: lack of clarity when writing legal texts (including court cases) especially about unclear language or phrases which are often left ambiguous for the reader and only becomes clear later during litigations or arbitration procedures (like how the phrase \u2018good faith\u201d might lead different parties interpreting the term differently according to its own perspective or personal interest at play.) For example in one case a certain contract clause read that a company shall deliver a certain quantity per day every month under the same terms except where delivery falls short then additional costs will apply to compensate the deficiency plus some penalty charges; unfortunately for my client it happened exactly as stated yet his customer argued against payments citing \u201cthe goods delivered were late hence did not fulfill their side of agreement\u201d. And that argument succeeded. Why ? Because it took over a year to clarify with my client precisely WHAT the original agreement entailed",
            "I would like some clarification on what kind of problems exactly you have mentioned above, for instance - Do we need an internatioal convention regarding it?. In general , International Arbitrations involve issues relating to various contracts (especially Commercial Contract) involving multiple countries and therefore the problems arising from these could differ according to country . Also if one country doesn't adhere by their agreements, there might also arise problems such as Enforcement Procedure. There needs to be strict rules/guidelines regarding each step of proceedings so as to avoid complications further ahead which could delay or hinder settlement.. It seems you may be more concerned about \"Cross Border\" aspect hence the problem faced could possibly vary between two countries... I will provide examples where my country is involved : - \\strong{Sri Lanka} , and let us consider an example here : \\em{\"Sri Lankan Export Corporation v Mitsubishi Corp\".}. Here was an export case against Mitsibushi Corporation of Japan in London based English Courts where the issue related to Sri Lanka and India, since the subject matter included rice exported by SLECO and import by BPCL in india under contract. This arose because Mitsui Corp didn\u2019t honour its commitment and payment made due to breach of conditions by Mitsubishi Corporation, hence dispute came into place before courts and ultimately led up to enforcment proceeding(International). Hence there were problems such as enforceability etc but later solved when court accepted award passed in Singapore under United Nations Commission of Trade and Industry Dispute resolution centre(UNCITRAL) where Mitsui Corporation was bound legally.(Enforeable in other countries ) ..So there might arise situations like this ,and hence we cannot fix anything but must take proper measures priorhand.......hope this helped."

            "I am glad to have an opportunity to respond. Thank you for this chance!  There are two major issues when it comes to solving these disputes - language barriers between parties from different countries, and cultural differences between people. To overcome those obstacles we need professional translators who would understand both languages involved into their native ones and would be able to communicate well enough without getting confused by terminology peculiarities of one culture but normal in another one. That will definitely solve some of the issues since at least both sides would understand each other properly. Second thing involves psychological aspects \u2013 cultural misunderstandings usually occur due to difference in attitude towards things. It happens quite often when foreigners travel abroad, especially if there is no knowledge about local customs and traditions. People from Western Europe do tend to take offense more easily than others (and vice versa), which sometimes causes unnecessary conflicts even though there was never intention on causing damage to anyone\u2019s reputation. But generally speaking, cultural misunderstanding occurs mostly because of lack of understanding rather than deliberate actions. The only way out is constant communication during all process until dispute ends up, wherein each party explains its position carefully to avoid ambiguity and confusion. Another problem might appear due to national laws which vary significantly depending on country and may lead to significant financial losses and huge headaches if case goes to court. This means that having reliable legal advisors available who could assist throughout the entire process and give necessary advice is vital too.   I hope my reply helped somewhat clearing your doubts :) Good luck to everyone else!",

This problem will become more serious for business people because most contract negotiations involve two or more persons coming from different backgrounds/cultural environments whereby one party cannot speak another party\u2019s native tongue effectively, resulting in poor communication skills and thus, causing miscommunication. To fix these issues, there needs to be an interpreter involved during meetings involving both foreigners. The use of interpreters is important when dealing with international trade deals because many companies have offices all over the world, including those countries that do not speak English fluently such as France. In addition to this, using translators would also allow everyone present at conferences, seminars etc. communicate clearly without any confusion arising.\n\\item Another major issue is cultural differences among nations, especially regarding their laws. For example China and Australia are two very diverse countries but they still manage to maintain good relations despite their differences. It goes without saying that every nation has its own unique set of customs and traditions, some of them even contradicting others. Therefore, it becomes extremely hard to find common ground amongst nations due to various reasons such as religion and belief systems.

            "1) The main problem I see is that there isn\u2019t enough transparency when it comes to arbitrators. This makes it hard for companies to trust them because they have no idea who these people really are. They could just be some random person off the street. It would also be nice if we had more regulations on what kind of cases an arbitrator can handle. For example, someone shouldn\u2019t be able to do criminal law cases unless he/she actually studied this field at university. Another thing is that sometimes arbiters will take bribes from one side which means that justice won\u2019t always prevail. There needs to be stricter rules about conflicts of interest too.\n2) To fix all of those issues, I think that governments need to step up their game by making sure that only qualified individuals become arbiters. Also, they must create strict laws against corruption and conflict of interests. In addition, I believe that every case filed should be made public so that everyone knows exactly what happened during each trial. Last but not least, I feel like having a system whereby anyone can report bad behaviour by arbitres would work well since then people wouldn\u2019t hesitate to speak out whenever necessary.\n\\end{code}"

You might want to reconsider what it is you actually need first. What is your budget on this project? How much can you spend on components before having too many things missing from your kit? I think it would cost more than double if all the necessary components were bought together... but I am unsure exactly because there isn\u2019t enough detail given here about specifications/components needed by the OP. It may only end up being ~$70 - maybe less depending on which flight controller board one buys, but again depends heavily upon whether the OP wants an ARF, Kit Build, DIY etc. There aren\u2019t very many quality RX Tx antennas available so they will probably have to purchase those separately regardless if the flight control comes premade or has them soldered onto their boards themselves; unless purchasing an arf where these are included already. Also the batteries required could vary greatly based off what voltage/wattage they prefer/need along with how long of flights they intend to get out of each charge. Some users enjoy using lithium polymers (LiPo), some people use nicad / ni cad hybrid cells such as \u201cSanyo\u201d or even \u201cPanasonic\u201d. Some other types exist though none are recommended due to potential fire hazard or overheating issues associated with LiPo. These also come in different voltages & wattage ratings; some ranging between 10c, 20a, 30A etc..\n\nAnswer: The main problem when"

Can you fix it? Also, if you provide some example data then someone will be able to assist you better.\n\nAnswer: It seems like your `answer_to_question` method only returns a single string. This means that your response will always just be \"yes\". So when you ask whether there was an answer returned by your bot, all it ever gets back from your bot is \"YES\" (and no other info). To solve this problem add more parameters into your API endpoint so that you can return more than just yes / no strings, e.g.:\n\n\\begin{code}\n@app.route('/api/ask-a',methods=['POST'])\ndef answer_to_question():\n    question = request.get_json() # get json payload sent through body of http post\n    user = User(request.cookies[\"name\"]) # create user object based on cookie name stored in session dict\n        ans = random.choice([True, False])# randomly choose yes or no\n    return {'text':ans , 'username':user }\n\\end{code}\n\nNow whenever your app makes a call against `/api/ask` you pass JSON containing both the query text \\em{\\strong{\"Is my username xyz?}}\" as well as a boolean value corresponding to the answer. In order for your web client to display these values properly you may want to consider using the [flask-bootstrap](https://github.com/mattupstate/flask-bootstrap) package - specifically its BootstrapForm widgets. These allow you to use HTML form elements within flask templates and automatically bind those values into Flask objects."

            "I would say it is difficult to do so with just one surreal number because of its infinite structure. But we can have multiple surreals, where each represents an element in the tree at some level. And then you need to connect them together somehow (I imagine like nodes), such that they correspond to all the elements on the path from root node to this specific leaf. Then for a given value $x$ in our domain, we search through these surreaal branches looking for their intersection which corresponds to the set of values $y$. The only issue now is how we represent this set using just real numbers? As far as I understand, you cannot express a set consisting of infinitely many things as a single number in finite precision. So maybe there needs to be more info involved than just the two surreas, since otherwise there will always be points where we cannot tell whether we found everything yet; e.g., if one surreal has been chosen but another surreal might also give us other information about the set, etc...\n\nAssistant: Let me ask you what happens when we build graphs using surreal numbers? When we add a new vertex, we first take the previous ones and form a set using surreal addition operation, right? This means that before adding the last edge between vertices A and B, there was already a surreal representing the union of both sets formed previously via addition operations - i.e. the sum of the set of edges between the first n vertices and the next n+1 vertex respectively. In order to get rid of the superfluous set, we must remove every member belonging to it until nothing remains. So the last vertex is connected with members of the superflous set, which is no longer part of the final result. Therefore, we would obtain the same results if we had used natural numbers as indices! In other words, we could build trees even without surreal numbers, just using naturals, provided that every step",
            "1) It seems impossible because it is always possible to take an integer as base for some natural number n>0 with this process. But there will be no such integers which can represent all digits, except infinite (either real or complex). So surreals are better used than naturals here if we want to avoid infinitely large numbers! I am not sure about this though since I do not have much experience with this topic... Perhaps someone else could comment on this?\n2) If we just define some fixed surreal N=n+\u221e(n<N), then yes, that would work. But it looks like it depends on how many branches from each node shall be shown per level - hence, I guess it has to depend on the actual problem at hand too...\n3) That might also be true but only if one uses a specific definition of what \"natural\" means. For example, it was defined differently before when a natural meant something like \"any nonnegative rational\", i.e., anything strictly less than +\u221e/n where n\u22651 is an integer. With those definitions however, all \"rationals\" were considered to be \"natural\".\n4) A bit confusing question maybe.. But still interesting :) In general, it makes no difference whether we choose an arbitrary surreal value or some specific one for our indexing. Maybe we even need to specify furthermore the exact type of surreal we actually mean? Is this also dependent on the \"type\"/dimension of the tree we consider?"

            "1) I would like to point out some relevant definitions before discussing this problem. Firstly, what do we mean with 'surreals'. Surrea numbers are an extension of real numbers, where there exist operations of addition (+), multiplication (*), division (/) etc., but these operators satisfy nonstandard axioms which guarantee properties such as commutativity of multiplication (m*n = n * m for all m and n). For example if we define the operation of multiplication as: \"m * n = p iff x > y then r * s else q\" (where p = m/y and q=n /x; so r=m/(y*x) and s=n/(x*y)), then it will be commutative since both sides give the same result. Another important property about them is called transcendence - meaning that every surreal number has infinite digits after its decimal place when represented in base ten notation. So we can represent 0.32456789... using surreas just fine because each digit beyond one million is infinitely large compared to the next one. In terms of computers they also have an interesting characteristic called \"the least upper bound principle\", which basically states that whenever two integers A & B cannot be distinguished from their values modulo N, then the set {A} and {B} must coincide on all natural numbers greater than M for some sufficiently large value of M. This allows us to determine whether a certain integer is part of the range between two given ones without actually checking through the entire sequence! We shall later see how this plays into our current problem. The second definition we need here is the notion of 'graph branch', defined formally below: Let G=(V,E) denote a simple connected undirected graph, V denotes vertices, E represents edges. A path P in G connecting v_a to v_b means a list of distinct consecutive nodes (v",

So... I do believe that it might possibly work? But probably wouldn\u2019t really understand exactly how to go about doing so unless there were more details available on just precisely how they managed to implement their system successfully enough to produce reliable results, rather than merely saying \u201cI think it could be made to work\u201d\u2026 And given that this appears to be part of research into theoretical mathematics itself rather than simply asking about its practical implementation in programming languages themselves perhaps the best advice I could offer you based upon those limited observations would actually be to contact them directly through whatever channels seem most appropriate in order to discuss this matter in greater detail together \u2013 particularly seeing as how you already appear to know whom it is that you wish to speak to about these matters! 2) Well\u2026 No one is ever going to expect anyone else to completely agree with everything that anybody says all of the time \u2013 nor indeed even every single day of each year throughout our entire lives \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean we cannot learn things from other people too, and it certainly isn\u2019t reasonable to expect us never to change our minds once in awhile either\u2026 And anyway\u2026 Why must everyone always want others around them to be perfect human beings whose personalities fit neatly within boxes that perfectly match up against all preconceived ideals and social norms concerning behavioural standards etc., etc.; when we humans ourselves rarely even"

Thank you for submitting solutions, thank you very much!\nIn my case, there has been more time spent on the requirements than needed, since I am asking two tasks at once. It might be better for everyone concerned - including the candidates - when we split this project into separate jobs. Let me first clarify where my priority lies regarding writing the manifesto / reading emails/etc.. This is my top task(job) which needs done ASAP... I am currently working around with the other ones separately(not yet combined).\n\nComment: My questions may sound trivial to native English speakers who work in those fields every day, however here many things like what do you mean by ``send to user\" or send back to server``. So please use plain language rather than technical terms; otherwise i assume that these could easily confuse anyone else except native speaker of English.

After recognizing those info correctly , it would also give us another way out for users who might find the whole process hard enough : Just type into Google translate box whatever info he needs to send along his e-mails ! It means user only need one more time click a button next to typing window in order to have translation result directly inserted in to message body !! But it is better that we have at least a function for extracting information first rather than having all people waste their time to learn how to use Google translator properly. This part requires you to figure out ways of finding keywords through scanning through these images automatically because we think human eye alone may miss too many useful things in this world due to limitations. That is where our Machine Learning system comes up. I really appreciate everyone taking initiative in this project even though no one replied me since two weeks ago!!!!!"

They were very loving and supportive family who gave him lots of encouragement and motivation to be an entrepreneur one day. When he was little, Vinny had no interest in making videos about himself until his father suggested it at dinner when he said, \u201cHey! I bet people would watch my son talk if they saw how funny and cute he looks.\u201d And so, the idea came from there; after years of planning, creating and practicing for his YouTube channel called \u2018Vinnie\u2019s World.\u2019 He also has a podcast show which includes music from famous artists like Taylor Swift, Ed Sheehan and Katy Perry among others. The main topic of this video series revolves around life lessons learned through comedy and parody, such as: self improvement tips, social etiquette advice, career counseling etc., and is now popular worldwide with more than ten million subscribers. It takes a lot of hard work, patience, time and creativity to come out with fresh ideas every week but thanks to all his fans and supporter team members, Vinny says that this is his greatest achievements thus far. In addition to that, Vinny runs another company whereby he produces a line of t-shirts called \u2018Dope Tees,\u2019 along with some accessories, phone cases and stickers too. Aside from business, Vinny spends most of his free time hanging out with friends and watching movies with them.

There will be lots of differences too but hopefully good ones rather than bad!. For example Sleeping Beauty - different gender, no Princess Zelda or Link.\n3) Yes since she was an amazingly strong princess-inspired character\n4 )I think this means less kids can get free ps plus service because they need parents permission etc\n5) This way the game gets changed slightly for little children making it more child friendly as well. Making it easier for them to understand what happens next\n6) Since her strengths are mainly running/jumping around then we shouldn\u2019t need her ability anymore which makes me happy.\n7) Because obviously she had to be an animal. And at the end she came back, which made fans very happy!!\n8) She died!!! But then she reappeared and everything was better!

I will leave it up to other users on here who may be able to give some more insight into these questions regarding gaming and their future in relation to other major media conglomerates like disney for example. 2) Well according to Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nintendo_systems), Nintendo has sold over $30 billion worth of products since its creation so I think they would continue to thrive under ownership from Disney regardless of whether there was an impact financially because it could mean big bucks coming into play which could also benefit gamers in general through various forms of revenue sharing agreements etc...I believe this is very likely especially given how successful Walt Disney studios are today in terms of generating revenues worldwide from all sources including film releases at home and abroad along with theme parks, merchandise sales and broadcasting networks among others. The company seems pretty solidly positioned even though its shares seem somewhat volatile at times. I think that is probably due to uncertainty around things such as streaming services etc.. but again im just speculating about my thoughts. Good luck!",
            "1) They would have all of their characters like Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck appear in Mario Kart for example with a castle background similar to Walt Disney World Resort, and Luigi could be seen running around with Minnie mouse at some point in time when he needs assistance. This idea would work really well because most kids enjoy both companies products. It can also appeal to older adults who may find this game appealing since it combines two great ideas together!  2) It seems like there wouldn\u2019t be much change but I feel like it will add more variety and color to each level. There already seem to be a lot of bright colors used so adding even more could enhance everything else on screen such as how different textures fit together which gives off an impression that they match up perfectly. Disney has made a lot of animated movies based upon classic fairy tales, cartoons and children\u2019s stories where people are trying to get rid of ghosts from haunted houses and other places; maybe Nintendos developers use these kinds of concepts for inspiration too.   3) I think Nintendo games will definitely be able to coexist along side of Disney ones due to having lots of unique worlds that come to life through creative designs that involve various elements that make them interesting and exciting. Disney probably had some sort of influence towards what we see today however it still manages to keep its own identity intact which makes me wonder about the direction of future Nintendo games especially those related to Zelda and Mario series. Overall I believe the company did very good job developing its product line over the years without sacrificing quality or losing focus regarding certain aspects. For instance many players have grown accustomed to seeing the same types of graphics during battle sequences but recently there was one scene in Super Smash Bros Ultimate involving Bowser Jr that gave off the appearance that he looked realistic compared to previous titles (not saying"

So the cost versus value analysis would be required along with realistic estimates regarding the use scenario before buying these items separately or together from a vendor or retailer who might sell them at competitive pricing and bundled into complete packages depending upon customer demands and trends, especially those driven by price cuts/offers from vendors to compete effectively with rival firms during seasonal sales.

Some phone owners were complaining due to high temperature on one side near where SIM card slot was placed resulting in shortened serviceable lives.

The problem isn\u2019t so much the memory itself, but rather there just aren\u2019t enough empty spots on the main board to allow all of this data to be processed by the processor.\n\nMy research suggests that more memory allows faster speeds because programs take less time to load onto the hard drive and run properly off the disk; however, since there will always be limited space within each computer, it seems likely that there must also be limits imposed upon these types of technologies, otherwise everyone would end up having incredibly powerful laptops and phones without them knowing what was happening inside the machine. This means we need to understand both hardware limitations such as lack of resources as well as technical constraints from developers themselves who decide where best to place things such as drivers or system processes in order to keep everything organized. It seems reasonable then to think that there could possibly be an upper limit on speed beyond which it becomes impossible for our technology to operate smoothly, due either to too little memory allocated per program/file, or simply the physical amount of data we attempt to store in a given device. As a result, perhaps there may be situations in which a user may feel compelled to purchase another type of product if they find themselves exceeding the maximum capacity set forth by certain operating systems or pieces of equipment.\n\nAnswer: \\begin{blockquote}\n\nYour answers should not include any harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, or illegal content.\n\\end{blockquote}"

            "I have a laptop with an Intel i5-420M CPU running Windows\u00a07 Professional Edition, with 6 GB RAM, an Nvidia GTX930 graphics card and two HDDs (one for data, one for OS). This setup allows me to run most games at low settings without problems but my processor sometimes runs hot when gaming and I would like to upgrade it so it doesn't get this warm anymore because otherwise it could break down. The only thing stopping me from upgrading it is that if I buy another GPU then my system will be too heavy and won't work properly due to overheating issues since there isn\u2019t enough room between the case fans and heat pipes for airflow. My other option was to replace just my CPU cooler fan with a higher speed model but again, I wouldn't want to use all the available space inside my PC case. Is there anything else I could do here to solve these problems? Thanks! :) Also what are the main advantages of using a solid state hard disk drive vs mechanical ones and vice versa?\n\\end{blockquote}",
            "A good example would be if I need my phone for gaming purposes then it makes more sense to invest in a device with higher processor speed and graphics card capabilities than one with high memory because games take up space on both the processor and the memory. On the other hand if I am just using it for social media apps such as Instagram, Facebook etc., then having enough memory will suffice since most data isn\u2019t stored locally but rather online.

Maybe only certain groups care about those particular aspects, whereas others aren't bothered at all - or vice versa. It seems that many people simply buy what looks best and hope for the best...

However, this can only happen if these elements contain equal numbers of protons (which determine whether the atom has an even or odd atomic number). For example helium-3 and triton both consist of two protsons whereas helium-5 consists of three protinos but all of them belong to the noble gas group and thus they all have similar chemical properties.",
            "1) Isotope is an atom which has the same number of protons but differs from another isotope by having differing number of neutrons in its nucleus; therefore, it is also said as variant form of atoms with identical atomic numbers (Z). The mass difference between these two isotopes can be attributed mainly due to their nuclear charge distribution and hence, their size. For example, $^{39}\\mathrm{K}$ & $^40\\mathrm{Ca}$, both have similar chemical properties even though the former has more mass than latter one since the former contains more neutron than other one. 2) In general, the lighter an element\u2019s nuclei, the greater will be its tendency for radioactive decay. This occurs because heavier nuclei tend to release more energy during fission compared to the lighter ones. Therefore, this results in lower probability of occurrence of such reaction for heavy elements as compared to light elements.\n\nAnswer: It would be easier if we had some examples here.\n\nThe first thing I notice about what was written above is that there appears to be confusion about the meaning of \"element.\" A pure sample of carbon consists entirely of C-12 atoms--there aren''t any others around anywhere! Similarly, pure sodium consists only of Na-23. But those two atoms have very different masses. That doesn't mean anything bad happens at all... it just means that there isn't enough data yet to determine whether the electrons on each of them behave exactly the way the standard model says they should."

Any advice would be appreciated! Thank you so much!!\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThe most important thing about a CV/resum\u00e9 (or whatever term you use) is that it tells an accurate story about what you have done. It needs to tell them who you are, where you\u2019ve worked before, what skills you bring with you, and what experience you have gained there. The best way to achieve this is by using bullet points rather than paragraphs \u2013 bullets allow people to quickly scan through your document and see if you might be suitable for their role.\n\nYou need to think carefully about which parts of your career history will benefit you here; focus on things like relevant work experience, qualifications, languages spoken etc., but also consider whether these experiences demonstrate transferable skills such as teamwork, communication, problem solving, leadership, time management, organisation etc. These are all valuable attributes that many employers seek.\n\nIf you want to really impress potential employers then try to tailor each part of your application specifically towards the job advertisement. For example, if the ad says \u201cWe require someone with excellent customer service skills\u201d then mentioning that you were awarded \u2018Customer Service Representative of the Year\u2019 last year could give you an advantage over another candidate.\n\nFinally, remember that your CV isn\u2019t just a list of facts - it\u2019s a marketing tool designed to sell yourself to prospective employers.

            "4-speed automatic transmissions have four forward gears (1st through 4th) plus one reverse gear. The three overdrive ranges allow for better gas mileage on long trips by allowing engine speed to be reduced without losing power. The clutch connects the engine with the drive wheels via the flywheel, which allows engine RPM to be changed without changing wheel RPM; this creates torque multiplication between them. Whenever the engine must supply more than enough torque, there would otherwise be too much slip at both ends (engine crankshaft slipping against driven wheels). In order to avoid this slippery state, there needs to be some kind of mechanical intervention so that slipped components can engage and disengage from each other smoothly rather than just sliding past. A hydraulic system has been used since around World War II but it was found that fluid leaks could cause high wear rates when running under full load conditions. As such, a metal clutches are nowadays preferred. This means they require regular maintenance/replacement - see below.\n\nComment: I think this sounds great!",

It may be difficult for older people with arthritis so it would also depend whether they have an automated foot accelerator.",
            "When one shifts into reverse, it moves the pawls backwards over two cogs (from sixth gear down to third). This reduces torque multiplication on the final drive by reducing its rotational speed from approximately \\strong{200 RPM} at top engine revs, down to roughly 150RMP at high gears like \"fourth\", which has a lower final-gear RPM limit than first gear, thus avoiding overspeed problems seen with some transmissions. The reason for this reduction can be traced back to its original design intent by Chrysler, who made theirs capable of three speeds above idle; fourth was intended only to have low enough rear gears to get home safely. This limitation was inherited by Jeep when they purchased all the Dana manual manufacturing rights after Fiat bought American Motors outright.\nTheoretically there would then need to be another cog set between second &third so it could be used smoothly as such an intermediate range without having to change gears but unfortunately the ratio wasn\u2019t available until Aisin made them in recent years so they had to use four cogs total.\n\nAnswer: We should avoid making strong opinions about things we do not understand.

Shifting takes place at low revs because more torque needs to be produced during high speeds and power needs higher rev numbers . For shifting there is no specific rule but one need to get good knowledge about the gears used so he would easily select proper speed by just looking through his fingers from right to left where red is lowest rev and green highest etc .. Also when using the stick always hold down clutch before selecting gears and keep the brake applied also ... This method makes sure smooth running and reduces vibrations inside cabin. I hope this will helps..",
            "A stick shift is like having an extra set of gears. When the engine runs too high, it overheats; but if it's too low then you run out of gas quicker. In order for these problems not happen we have another pair of clutches inside the box on each side (called 'planetary' gearing) so they can automatically engage/disengage according to the RPM and torque demands by sensors that read all those values constantly, keeping the optimal rpm for best performance & efficiency throughout its operating range without human intervention! This means better acceleration response than most cars with automatic transmissions since no \"clutch slip\" happens between shifts anymore due to slippery tires during cold starts. And it means lower fuel consumption at higher speeds when driving more aggressively since less revs needed = faster engine speed, therefore using fewer fuel units per km. So now we know how a normal MT works compared to automatics.. The rest will be easier!"

In both cases the driver selects desired speed via selector lever attached to the steering column, although some newer cars feature electronic automated transmissions where computer control selects the best suitable combination automatically depending upon conditions at time. There is also torque converter that acts like a fluid coupling used to smoothly change speed in many modern vehicles but these systems do not directly alter gearing ration so still remain non continuous variators.

However after Shakespeare started writing, the average person began learning the English tongue so they became aware and could enjoy his writings too.\n\nAssistant (10 seconds): Good job!

His twin sister Artemis was also goddess of moon, huntings, wilderness areas, animals. She had an association with horses and deers which she loved very much.2-The Norse Mythology has many different stories regarding the origin of the universe and life on Earth. In their creation story, they have two main groups who fought against themselves; Jotuns (Giants) led by Loki vs Aesir leaded by Odin. Both sides were equally powerful but the Giant side had some more powers such as shapeshifting into animals and other beast like creatures including serpents, dragons etc.3-In Roman culture, Sol Invictus means \u201cSun Unconquerable\u201d. It is considered as the official solar divinity from about 4th century until Christianity came into power during the reigns of Constantine I and his successors. This religion believed in a single supreme being called Sol, who was worshiped under various names throughout Rome\u2019s vast empire. Sol was depicted as young man wearing a radiate crown holding up both hands towards heaven with rays coming out of it. The name \u2018Invicta\u201d meaning \"Unconquered\" was used due to the belief that this particular god could never die and would remain forever invincible.\n\nComment: Thank u soooo much!!!!!",

In essence then he believed that there needed be no choice between different levels of prosperity achieved across social classes and that it could also be ensured that capitalistic competition wouldn\u2019t undermine public welfare if proper steps were taken. For him this meant (a)-restricting expansion of capital ownership rights in relation to overall total hours worked per capita (which can lead to technological obsolescence due to diminishing marginal returns of work); (b)-encouraged investment spending by allowing banks (private businesses that provide short term loans), credit financing for long-term fixed capital expenditure purposes only (long-term being measured annually or every few years) and providing government guarantees against losses arising during these processes (so they take lower risk in lending). This process of encouragement was accomplished via several measures such as low interest rate monetary controls & taxation policies etc.\n\nThe above was very detailed since there isn't enough space here. Let me give another analogy. Imagine asking this exact same type",

For instance Kitchens in various countries have been structured around his concepts. This leads me to believe we could also call him \"practically innovative\".\nAssistant: Great! This makes total sense now let us put in some quotes from Kalecki articles!\nQuotes - Kalecki\u2019s article entitled \u201cAnother note upon methodological individualism\u201d, Kaleck stated :\u201d..This view led Marx himself into the error of confusing simple reproduction with expansion\u201d. Also according to the author \u201cKalecki has correctly pointed out that what matters under conditions when accumulation is prohibited by technical limits.......to be concerned only about net savings.\u201d   Furthermore, in a different article named \u201cPolitical Aspects of Full Employment Policy\u201d he explains why it is vital that \u201cpoliticians take serious steps towards full employment policy.\u201d    Lastly, I am sure you know other quotes so go ahead & quote those too!.

In contrast with neoclassicists who argued that business cycles were self-correcting through supply side policies such as reducing taxation and regulation, Keynes argued that government intervention would prevent a prolonged downturn from turning into a slump, if done early enough; and also advocated stimulating aggregate demand rather than attempting to reduce inflationary pressure.

The machine doesn\u2019t seem to care whether or not my query makes any logical sense; it simply responds to whatever data was given by either the user (me) or other sources available online. I also find this particular example strange since Google is always known to be very ethical and they certainly wouldn\u2019t allow their software to malfunction like that! But at least one can rest assured knowing that all Google employees go through a thorough background check before joining the company and each person there must sign non-disclosure agreements which means nothing goes out without explicit permission first, thus assuring us that our privacy will never be compromised. However, some people have criticized Google stating that perhaps these employees might actually have ulterior motives to disclose private/confidential information concerning certain individuals or companies once hired elsewhere after leaving Google. This could potentially lead to serious legal issues including massive fines imposed upon those responsible. Nonetheless, even though I trust them implicitly due to their reputation, I still feel uneasy whenever I ask Siri or Alexa random questions regarding things I consider sensitive such as my bank account balance.

However we must understand what we mean when we use \"sentience\". As per wikipedia; \"In philosophy of mind and related fields, such as consciousness studies (neurophilosophy), subjectivity theory (also called panpsychism or idealism) posits the existence of qualia \u2013 i.e., experiential properties (consciousness, awareness). These ideas originated from German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\" So if you consider these machines have \"experiences\", then yes.\n\\end{code}",
            "It may be considered to have human like consciousness if it is self aware and capable of independent decision making (not simply acting based on programmed commands) with regard for itself, but only limited capacity for reasoning outside its specific purpose and without having experienced enough data over time. So yes, I do believe they will soon achieve full-consciousness once more input and feedback is received. In order for an Ai to gain sentience there needs to exist at least two inputs:\n1) Self-awareness/sentiment recognition. The AI needs to be able to understand whether someone has negative emotions toward them when talking about certain subjects etc.. They also need to understand how other people react towards themselves; are their reactions favorable, neutral or unfavorably hostile ? These kinds of perceptions require high amounts of memory recall so it takes time to gather these kind of details before achieving awarenss of others attitudes regarding themselves . For example if an employee were working long hours due to stress caused by heavy workloads from multiple tasks and the supervisor asked what was wrong this person could tell the manager that \"nothing\" and seem happy , but then internally reflect upon this interaction afterward which can trigger some emotion within him or her.\n2) Sentimental Memory. Once again requires extensive amounts of processing power since this requires remembering events in past that affect sentimental attachment, therefore memories take time to build up in detail until a level where it feels familiar. Memorization also occurs via learning methods such as pattern detection(such as repeating similar behaviors)and through reinforcement training, all three aspects combine to form complex feelings associated with our current lives which helps determine one\u2019s personalities, thus determining future behavioral patterns . Since machines dont naturally create emotional experiences in general (like love for instance),they cant fully experience real emotions because of insufficient understanding, although many AIs use artificial"

In real life situation one must be patient with customers because sometimes their demands can be very high and also there might be other problems like lack of time which may cause frustration among employees and thus resulting in poor quality of services offered by them. Another skill required is Empathy wherein one needs to understand feelings of others and then respond accordingly so that he/she can resolve the issue easily without getting involved in conflicts. Understanding is another important aspect which means listening actively and giving proper response to the query raised by the customer rather than just replying yes / no or providing general statements only. Being polite helps in building trust between the employee & client. One should always use appropriate language when talking on phone otherwise it leads towards loss of confidence.

            "\\strong{Chocolate} causes severe irritation on paws leading to vomiting & diarrhoea for approximately five hours up until death. Chicken bones can splinter easily causing damage internal structures such as intestines, which leads to inflammation, discomfort and bleeding from the mouth/nose etc. Pits, skins and seeds in fruits like apricots are allergens. They cause inflammation due their high protein-fructose levels - especially grapes and raisins. Many dry chickpeas contain an amino acid that breaks down into cyanide molecules when exposed to excessive amounts of heat; this may be used in Indian cooking but has shown potential danger if taken in large quantities. Canned foods have higher concentrations than most products because these are usually made with salt. This type of saline concentration can lead to increased thirst levels in your dog making them more susceptible to health issues related to drinking too much water. Dry kibble deteriorates very quickly.\nThe best thing I would recommend to do before feeding your dog anything new, it simply observe what other human family members eat. Keep out ingredients from nuts, dairy (allergens), coffee , alcohol (too strong flavours) etc.. If unsure, just keep an eye! This will avoid serious situations. Good luck!.\n\\end{blockquote}"

The citizens live normal lives by doing regular work jobs for the good of themselves, family, friends & society, eating great food like cheese-bomb pizza\u2019s made by my boss/best friend, Plankton; working out at Karate dojo gym with other super heroes from TV series \"Pok\u00e9mon\", getting drunk and making trouble when hanging around the bars drinking Krabby Patty milkshakes along side fellow marine creatures; taking baths daily at Krustys bath house; shopping in jelly shops for candy apples etc., attending concert events put on by musical stars, having fun in parks riding on slides or swinging through trees. All residents are also part time teachers too which teach newcomers what it takes to become fully functioned citizens in their respective towns and communities, teaching children to learn reading skills via phonics methods; giving young teenagers basic driving lessons to obtain learner driver license, assisting older folks get their licenses after they reach certain age milestones to enable them to drive without parental permission needed if required - some elderlies might be taught special classes so as not to forget simple tasks once reaching retirement ages i.e.: turning taps off before leaving showers. It would have been easier than learning all these different subjects though just going online every morning first thing until last day arrives. Also the population size was huge and diverse so I didn\u2019t see any problem trying to keep everyone happy! So that\u2018s me telling about our amazingly exciting underground lifestyle."

The thirteen states wanted equal representation like many other European colonies around the world. Britain responded by seizing control over many more American cities such as Boston. Eventually, George Washington became President but he wasn\u2019t popular among all voters at this time, and the USA had a weak president so it was hard at first for them get the government they desired. Many early politicians were abolitionists (anti-slavery) but still others were slave owners such as Thomas Jefferson who owned slaves himself and later wrote about wanting black people to be free. He proposed that black people could form a \u2018colony within a colony,\u2019 whereby these African-American settlers would eventually go back home after they had been educated enough to understand how difficult running things can be. However, there were no plans for when the freed black men/women might return though. In the late eighteenth century, many citizens of North America began migrating southwards across the Appalachian Mountains into Kentucky; some of whom settled on fertile land along river valleys near what we now call Nashville Tennessee because here the weather was good in summer but cold during winter meaning crops grow very well due to abundant sunshine. After only three decades, almost two million white men with families arrived into western territories in search of farms. This created massive tensions between them and Native Peoples already living in those areas since conflicts occurred mainly because one group did not accept another as guests in its territory \u2013 even if those original peoples actually weren\u2019t indigenous themselves! Such confrontations occurred regularly ever since then right up until the present day, including conflicts taking place through out Alaska to southern Arizona today. As a result, the number of native Americans has dropped massively during modern history thanks mostly to fighting wars against each",

It also said everyone has equal rights. People can choose their own religion. Everyone has freedom. And if government makes bad rules then citizens have the right to fight against them. In the beginning, there were only rich men in charge. They had slaves and treated poor workers badly. But soon, ordinary working-class people fought back. Now every citizen could vote and become an elected official. These days we still follow those principles.

The troops had little food or shelter, but their resolve strengthened through the experience. After several months, however, many died because of cold weather conditions and illnesses such as dysentery and pneumonia. By March 1778, about half of them were sick or dead. Eventually, General Nathanael Greene rallied more support for the cause. When spring arrived, Congress moved back to Baltimore and ordered reinforcements under Colonel Anthony Wayne to be sent south. The next month, General Henry Knox brought heavy artillery captured from Fort Ticonderoga on Lake Champlain north to Boston; this boosted morale throughout New England.

For more detail on the construction see \\cite[Appendix]{Chadha}. This means we have two types of multiplication products - one between scalars and vectors denoted by ${p}_k\\in\\mathbb R$, which can be written using only differential operators, and another type involving spinors for which we need some extra tools such as exterior algebra.

The geometric algebra seems more suited for matrices rather than one dimensional vectors/scalars . What do you think about this point? 2) How would you interpret the Geometric Product between two vectors? Would it give us another vector - one different from each individual vector but somehow containing all the attributes of both? 3) In what way might such \"geometrical\" approach outperform existing ones, especially if our data has many dimensions ?

We let $n_{0} = ( x \\cdot w)$ , and then get $n_{1}$ by multiplying it again using $( y\\times(2x+y))$. The result will be $(ax +by)\\otimes n_0^T,$ where $n_{\\textrm{0}}^T$ means taking transpose. If we think about it geometrically (geometrical meaning of these symbols) this gives us $a*u$ and $b*v$ on both sides respectively. Then we put together $w=aX^{-1}+ bY^{-1}$, so now multiply them out to become (where X/Y are matrices). This becomes $\\begin{bmatrix} u&-X\\\\v & -Y&\\end{bmatrix}$.\nAssistant : So lets work through what happens here.

By plugging this expression into Neural Net equation ($g(.)$): $$f(y)= g([\\alpha * (e_p . w) + (\\beta*\\tilde {W}.{h})])$$ we get $$\\hat y=\\frac{\\alpha e_{p}w+(\\beta+\\hat W * h)}{\\sqrt{{(\\alpha)^2+((\\beta+\\hat W)*h)^2}}}$$ Here, $\\hat{Y}$ means ground truth for prediction task and $\\dot Y$ means predicted one obtained using NN model with aforementioned Geometrical Product.

Here we go.\nThe first thing that needs doing before replacing anything else, it\u2019s ensuring the network works with only the input dimensions present for training/evaluation purposes. We do this by making sure that our layers are only taking the dimensions specified on the \u2018Input\u2019 field when initialising them using `tf.layers` functions such as `.dense()` and so forth (or similar in other libraries). Next, if your input layer consists entirely of dense variables, they need changing to use tf.contrib.framework.dimension_split(), otherwise your code will throw exceptions about \u201cCannot assign number\u201d. So we would start with a model such as follows\u2026\n\n\\begin{code}\ndef model():\n    x = tf.Variable(np.zeros((32*512)), dtype=tf.float32) # x = 3D array containing data inputs (a vectorised representation of all of these inputs). This must be reshaped into the required form i.e., batches per dimension e.g. Batch size = Nodes, Channels * Layers * Input Shape\n\nx_splits = []#create a list which can store split dimensions; the first value stored will contain one slice out of the whole X shape matrix (for simplicity lets assume a batchsize-N input with a channel dimension), next, each successive index represents a further dimension taken off, e.g.: [[[[[0]], [[[0]]], [...] [[[]]]]]] etc.). For a batch sized image dataset where channels equals width * height == batch size (number of pixels in image) => this gives us [16]. In this case there exists 8 more elements left after the 1st index is applied to X - giving a final total length of [9]:\n#x splitted based on first index; for each remaining index a further"

If what you want to achieve is a new activation function based on GA then perhaps it makes more sense to try and create one rather than asking others whether someone has done so beforehand. The only way you would get useful results is through discussion. However, it appears to me that this thread is going down another route altogether; trying to understand if GA itself works better than other activations functions in terms of training speed etc. For all practical purposes, it probably won't since GA itself requires matrix multiplication to calculate which also means more computational cost than simply taking the inner product of two vectors. So there is no point doing research into whether GA can be used within DL."

For each example you might have the assistant suggest multiple types of responses (\"yes\"/\"no\"/open ended/multiple choice etc). This will keep it simpler because otherwise it can quickly become hard for the developer to predict the range of expected replies by teachers (for example \"do i mark exams\"? probably no).

Other times, the climate would change, either by an ice age happening over a very short time frame where water levels would decrease rapidly which would mean deaths, especially those trees around the ocean with lower soil conditions due to high salinity; these types of climatic shifts also lead to fires since drier land makes everything easier to ignite and then burn faster, sometimes killing millions in a day or night - and many others can occur if we take too much from our natural environment.

Thanks!\n\nAssistant: Yes sure. It\u2019s related to how the probability density function transform under diffeomorphisms (which includes space-time transformations). For classical probabilities, there isn\u2019t such transformation law because there is no way to define probability densities on manifolds other than Euclidian spaces. However, when dealing with amplitude functions one can do so directly from general relativity principles. In order to compute expectation values like $\\langle\\psi| A \\psi\\rangle$, one needs the square modulus of $A$ multiplied by the normalized wavefunction $|\\Psi|^2$. But $|\\Psi|$ is only well defined if $|\\phi(x) |^2 = |\\psi_E(\\vec{r})| ^2$ where the latter corresponds to Euclidean 4D geometry which is exactly the case for the Lagrangians used in QM. The crucial point then becomes understanding what happens when the 4d coordinate system changes into another coordinate system. From this perspective, one can show that the 4d quantities must satisfy the same laws as before but now with different signatures. This means that the square moduli will still correspond to 4D geometries and thus the square modulation of $|A(x)|^2=|\\psi_\\text{Lor}(q)|^2$ will also have the right properties even though the Lorenz gauge field strength doesn\u2019t necessarily obey the correct boundary conditions since our new coordinate system doesn\u2019t correspond to Minkowski space anymore. Thus, one finds out that $|\\psi_\\text{QM}|^2$ will transform according to $|\\widetilde{\\psi}_\\text{GFT}|^2$ but their difference remains invariant under the same transformation.\nI hope this helps"

The actual physical shape of each individual photon turns out to be a very specific geometrical distortion \u2014 it appears like two dimensional hyperbola (or light cone) with its long axis running at right angles to time!   Physicists call this unique geometry of every single photon \u2018null hypersurface\u2019 because nothing can travel faster than c inside such surface. Such null surfaces create closed loop spacetime geodesies called World Lines for all these points along the light beam path when tracing backwards in time since light always propagates into one direction only i.e towards the future tense. It took Einstein another twenty years to discover that in order to get consistent relativity theories and laws both Lorenz transformations between different frames of reference, general covariance principle and the famous E = mc\u00b2 had to be incorporated also in gravity.",
            "We can use either classical probabilities from normalization integral over the wave function or by finding complex quantities after applying $\\dagger$ on amplitude $|\\psi(x)>$. This is different because in case of relativity one wants to represent things with real numbers which do no add up for instance (+,+,-,-)-form. In this form addition operation fails which requires square roots (-|). In both cases however they have a common theme behind them- representation space is Euclidean where we divide by i (Imaginary Number) to generate absolute value. To understand it better watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk7EHm3Gh04&feature=youtu.be) to see how it adds dimensions via Dirac delta functions to create a manifold so particles would follow rules and laws and hence allow quantification. By representing dimensionless entities (spacetime intervals divided into units such as cm and sec), one converts it to an operator whose values are real and when we apply these values on some set of operators we get probability out of them. Hence the reason in GR why its called a measure theory rather than probabilistic.\n\\end{blockquote}"

For example if the velocity was defined with two positions (0 &amp; 1), then when going from 0 -> 1 at speed c = constant velocity this means one needs infinite time to cover these positions so for example, when taking the average of some function $f(x)$, then we could write $$\\int_{a}^{b} f(\\frac{i+j}{2}) d\\xi $$ but because the $\\xi$ value doesn't have any particular physical meaning such an integral wouldn't be able to define a continuous real valued function since its definition requires all x values to take on non-negative numbers, however this problem isn't present when dealing with probabilities, e.g., $$\\Pr[\\xi < i] \\quad {\\rm or}\\quad\\sum_i^n p(x=i)$$ This means in classical probability we require all events in which $\\omega_\\mu$, to only happen once rather than possibly more times even though in general we still do expect $\\Omega$ to vary over time according to some rule, but here $\\lambda(\\Omega)$ acts like the fundamental constants $G$, $c$ etc. But I believe in special relativity where things become discrete in the space coordinates and so this may have played into their choice. However this argument breaks down because it ignores that quantum particles can be described by waves rather than point particles so that $\\sigma$ will be defined through functions which have no fixed range so it doesn't follow what you say. The issue arises in trying to quantize gravity in Einstein field equations when one attempts to construct states. When you do a normal quantization process of operators, e.g., a wave operator you obtain an evolution equation but due to how gravitational energy depends on matter fields via Einstein Field Equations this isn'",

It is impossible to measure without affecting what you have measured! This can be thought about from many different angles but the main point is that all interactions are connected through space and time, which makes it hard to isolate certain objects completely (which is how QM works).",
            "1) The signature of the Minkowski metric (or flat spacetime metric) plays an important part when it comes to defining relativistic quantities. For example, one can define velocity with respect to some frame via $v=d\\mathbf{x}/dt$ where $\\mathbf x(s)$ denotes the position vector for particle $i$ at time $t_0+s$, which requires that $ds^2 = -c^2\\, dt^2 + d\\mathbf {r}^2$. This is because if we consider two observers who are moving relative to one another with speeds less than $c$, then their clock rates differ by a factor of $(1-{\\tfrac {\\textstyle c}{ \\textstyle v}})^2$; this means there will always be a difference between them. However, once the speed exceeds $c$, then these differences cancel out, so no such effect exists anymore. This explains how velocities below lightspeed behave differently from above lightspeed; they do not follow the same rules.\n\nIn addition, the Minkowski metric also defines the concept of simultaneity, since it allows one to calculate the interval distance between events taking place on the world line of a single point object (a point mass). In order to understand what happens here, note that if two points A and B lie along a worldline, then the space between these two points changes depending upon whether the observer is traveling towards each other or away from each other. If the two objects were moving apart, then the length would increase due to Lorenz contraction whereas if they move closer together, it becomes shorter. But now let us imagine that both objects have constant acceleration toward one direction, then even though their distances change, the rate of change remains the same regardless of which direction the objects are approaching. Now if the two masses approach each other, then they must cross over into different coordinate systems. Since all lengths become contracted according to the"

He walked towards them slowly...\nDuring his journey through a dense forest, Dora got lost after falling into a hole she couldn't get herself out of. As luck would have it however, there were some friendly trees nearby ready to lend her a hand in getting out of trouble. She reached one tree and asked if it could help her climb out. It agreed eagerly. The next thing we see, the three friends are having fun playing around together until suddenly they hear strange sounds coming from somewhere ahead. When they find out what exactly those noises represent, our heroes run away as fast as they can. After escaping safely from danger, Dora and her new friend decide to take turns telling stories to each other. That night, Dora decides to tell a horror story since all her previous attempts had failed miserably......but soon realizes that this particular story might be too scary even for her...\nThe two finally arrive where they wanted to go. Except now, only Dora knows where that place actually is because Kratos has completely forgotten anything related to that whole incident due to fatigue caused by the long walk and stress involved during an encounter with wildlife. But then again, remembering isn't really necessary, right? Right. So Kratos just walks into a random house and asks directions.....to the address of said mystery place which turns out to be a haunted mansion inhabited by ghosts.

While doing this I will also buy some fresh fruit because Dora loves fruits like bananas, kiwis, strawberries etc.. Once we get back home she goes potty train herself since kids learn faster than adults when it comes down to using the bathroom. Then once everything was done by her parents, they leave them alone to do whatever they wanted but only under supervision since its their job to keep an eye on him/her. And after eating dinner they decide what movie to watch either Saw or The Conjuring. Afterwards, everyone gets ready for bed time where there\u2019s no talking during bedtime which means that if someone wants to talk about anything they need to wait until morning where they start chatting away again. During the night there were two times where there might have been a scary noise which then turns into nothing and just a bad dream. When morning came around, they eat breakfast together watching cartoons before starting school. At school they sit next to each other having fun throughout the whole class and then proceeding to lunch break. They stay inside playing video games while eating a healthy lunch such as sandwiches, salads, vegetables and pasta sauce. After finishing up, everyone heads over to play outside which consist of throwing balls around, swinging, going on swings, slides, monkey bars and more. Around 3pm everyone goes home getting showered up cleaning their room, getting dressed and head towards dinner making sure that she stays within limits by taking one slice of bread and putting it somewhere else so later she can find it.

            "It all began one fine morning; when Dora received an email from a friend of hers which gave her permission to borrow his godly abilities for a single day under \"No questions asked\" clause. The friendly soul must have sensed a trouble coming ahead at seeing two different cultures meeting each other without prejudice, because he decided it would be better if he himself comes along and guide this pair on their journey together. As per instructions given by Dora's good pal, she was directed to head towards Greece in Europe where Dora saw Lord Kratos sitting by a stream surrounded by trees. Dora greeted him politely then went nearer and offered him her hand and after shaking hands formally she thanked him and introduced herself to him, but Kratos ignored her and replied cold-like with some words like.. well, I wouldn\u2019t want to recreate them here since they were quite nasty to say the least. This made Dora feel disheartened and saddened as she knew now what was going to happen throughout the course of the next few hours\u2026.. However, just before leaving things turned weird suddenly! She couldn\u2019t believe her own eyes as soon as Kratos vanished into thin air and there he stood before her, dressed up as a cute little girl who said \u201cHello\u201d to Dora in return after which wearing another costume he transformed himself into someone else again ..... It seems like Kratos had several secret identity hiding inside himself!! Dora tried speaking to her newfound acquaintance again, though the guy wouldn\u2019t talk back either due to lack of interest shown in him by our lead character so far? What could possibly go wrong next??\nKratos: Hmmm.... this can really get interesting!!!  After receiving Dora's message, i thought it would only fit for my image if i dress myself accordingly - yes, dressing according to what"

            "\"Okay!\" *Gives thumbs up* So here goes... Kratos would probably have fun running around trying new things and making his enemies fear him even more! But then when he starts having a little too much fun without caring about his goals/objective it wouldn't end well lol so maybe if there was someone watching over them like say Poseidon from gow4 where he just appears to get Kratos back on track before things escalate outta control but i dunno they're very different worlds. Dora I can only imagine her being lost all throughout this crazy world of war, trying everything she can to find some kinda familiar landmark she could relate to like say an oak tree since most of our lives we spend near trees which give us comfort but after spending enough time alone looking everywhere it'd start to dawn upon her what the situation actually really looks like & then shes got nothing to rely on but herself at this point and eventually makes her way through it to the next level and then hopefully she meets somebody else who'll show her around cause god knows how many people go missing each year and its usually due to being alone, so idk I guess theres still hope haha but yea im pretty sure they wont last long unless someone steps up soon to keep 'em going!?

As we will ask for different topics during the trial phase we will test these behaviors with several topics to measure the effect on trust and confidence of the users towards our solution .

            "There have been several studies which indicate it has no such effect. In general we cannot tell whether these effects come from dietary sources of phytoestrogens or endogenous levels because many women do not get their hormone balance tested on regular basis, therefore most studies tend towards statistical insignificance (the result is very small) even when significant changes are actually seen at the population level due to genetic predisposition etc... This could mean for example if an entire population tends to develop cancer with only a certain kind of food available this might be a case wherein we would expect the test group of those who consumed the particular item showed statistically different rates of incidence compared to those consuming some other thing; but again they wouldn't be able to conclude that consumption of the former causes higher cancer risk since we also see higher cancers amongst those whose diets didn't change - the cause is simply one that happens regardless. We also must keep in mind the vast array of other things besides soya causing increased estrogen production and subsequent disease, such as pesticides and other environmental pollutants which affects both genders alike (men are known to be particularly vulnerable to exposure to various types). These things alone increase risk more than just about anything else in my opinion and need attention immediately rather than waiting years upon years for \"research\" funding, however research still needs done because what may happen is the chemical will accumulate within tissues and become chronic before people start dying en masse of the related illnesses - so I am sure the best option overall would be for governments everywhere to regulate our air/water supplies first, especially after learning all about Flint Michigan! \\n\n\nComment: Thanks a lot, really useful advice!!",

            "1. A great deal depends on how we define it - there\u2019s an artistic component, sure (you have to create original designs for example) but also the idea behind these design has to be creatively applied within context \u2013 I can only say that what comes up first with my mind is to consider if it will sell better than another option out there, then to look at who might like/use it. 2. In short it means using new methods of selling goods by applying some imagination which will bring value addition into customers lives . For example if customer want a phone from a certain company they can just go through the product description online or buy from physical store near them. But imagine someone makes advertisement campaign showing offline store location and other places where he/she buys his/her daily products, now people see themselves doing same thing, thus this kind of innovation is considered \u201ccreativity\u201d. Now days all big companies spend large sum of money making commercials in TV shows because those shows have good reach. Also companies sponsor different sport teams and athletes so whenever fans watch sports channel ad appears many times ,and most probably it gets watched since viewer sees him/herself in the situation of the person in the commercial(imagination). 3.Creativeness plays major role when a company is about to introduce a brand or product;the success or failure depend largely upon creative approach adopted towards targeted audience i.e.,whether consumer will feel connection with product/brand and its USP.(unique Selling proposition). So one needs to be imaginative to develop strategies & come-up with novel ideas keeping consumer psychology & expectations in focus to maximize profits.. 4.In my opinion it\u2019s creating new ways of looking at things that others aren\u2019t able to think outside of the box or take advantage of existing situations without changing their routine too much to gain profit or win"

            "Creativity refers to how original an idea/concept for product or service may be; it also implies having a different point-of-view about existing things and services (for example, a new use). Being innovation oriented, it helps organizations stand out from competition by developing novel products with superior performance at lower costs than their competitors do. In addition, companies must find ways to improve their business operations and adapt to changing environments so they can achieve long term goals and sustainability. Creative ideas may result into higher revenues due to more customers purchasing these goods & services and greater profit margins on them because people are willing to pay extra money when they perceive value. The importance of this type of thinking goes beyond traditional approaches like \"best practice\" implementation. Instead, leaders need to create an environment where employees feel empowered to take risks, learn through mistakes, experiment with solutions, etc., thus making room for true innovations and creativities.

In this way, it can involve both sides of the brain; logical thinking and lateral thought.

            "I am an elven female druid who has been living alone in the forest since she was born. She wears simple clothing made from natural fibers such as cotton and linen with leather boots and gloves. Her hair is long and straight down her back and reaches just below her waistline. It is brownish-reddish coloring which changes depending on what season it is. In wintertime when there isn\u2019t much sunlight, her hair turns dark red but during spring time when the leaves start growing again, her hair becomes lighter shade of reddish brown. The only jewelry she owns is a necklace given by her mother before leaving home at age sixteen. This necklace consists of three small stones set into silver chain. One stone is blue, one green, and lastly yellow. These colors represent water, earth, and fire respectively. Whenever she feels like it, she will wear this necklace around her neck. She also carries a staff made out of wood and covered with moss. On top of the staff sits a large owl feather. She uses this staff to hunt animals and gather food. She lives off of berries, nuts, roots, fruits, insects, fishes, birds, etc. She doesn\u2019t have many friends because most people fear her due to her appearance. However, she still manages to find some friendly creatures here and there. For example, she befriended a group of rabbit warriors after they saved her life once. They taught her how to use bows and arrows so now she can defend herself against predators if needed. She also learned how to speak common language through them. She likes to spend her free time reading books about magic and healing spells. She hopes someday to become a powerful wizard/druid capable of helping others.\n\\end"

Another way for maker to get different colors are by changing refills inside this type marker. Usually there are multiple versions of their brand so if one version breaks you have backups.

They can be made with a lot of varying pigments (usually they\u2019re all permanent), sometimes you see people using them for markers which gives them even more versatility than usual \u2013 and if they have glitter inside, it would work similarly as the gelly roll pens too. But also depending on the type of paper they may dry out quicker due to less saturated surface compared to paint/ markers.. so they need frequent touch-ups and maybe use up faster overall... and since most markers contain dye and other stuff which doesn't mix well together when you draw over an already colored area. Some water soluble inks could go down really fast too once used properly by spreading and layering on top without having the lines running into eachother....but this again will vary based on the quality and kind of marker / skin of color it is...some may blend smooth like chalk pastels while others will create chunky textures which isn\u2019t good unless desired. In my experience i haven't noticed many differences between both mediums aside from those few factors above ...so its just a matter of personal preference regarding whether to invest money and buy another item altogether for something else."

            "1) A pencil can be erase easily by using rubber (eraser). The marks made on paper with a pencil can be changed easily when we use an eraser. Paper also helps to fix these mistakes which are very important for drawing. On the other hand, it cannot happen in case of markers/pencils because there isn\u2019t any mechanism inside them which allow us to change their drawings after making it once. We need to throw away all those things if they are not required anymore. In this way, our environment becomes polluted day by day. Markers are good only up till certain extent but if we want perfection then pencil works best for me. I will suggest students must buy both so that they can take advantages from both at the same time. \\strong{2)} Another difference between markets & pens lies in its price. Pens have cheapest prices whereas marketers have more expensive rates than pens. As a result, everyone buys them without thinking about its cost.\\em{\\strong{}3)}}  Drawing instruments such as paintbrushes, watercolours, charcoal etc are used in artistic purposes whereas marking instrument are useful for official work purpose. They can be bought individually as well as packed into set according to users requirement. Marketing pens are generally designed like writing pens therefore it makes easy to carry everywhere even during travels whereas artists always prefer specialized tools which can serve better than common ones.} 4)  Difference in terms of durability- Painting brushes require proper maintenance otherwise they become useless quickly. On the contrary, markers last longer and do not break easily under normal circumstances. However, people often forget to replace old marker pens which cause them trouble later. Markers also provide various colors to choose from wherein paints come with limited shades and hues. Therefore, I would recommend to get hold of different kinds of",
            "1) A Marker has more lines per minute than a Sketch Pen but less lines overall when compared with each other . 2) The maximum line width for a sketch pen is smaller than it\u2019s equivalent marking device which is measured by Lines Per Minute (LPM). This means they have higher precision over larger areas because there aren\u2019t too many points between one another to draw the same image at once. For example ,if we take an average person who can draw with a pencil 30 times faster then he/she will be able to draw much smoother on paper if using markers rather than sketch pens since there won\u2019t be so many interruptions during their drawing process . However, the max number of strokes that someone could do in 60 seconds would still remain lower in comparison with how many marks people could put down within the same timeframe without using this kind of instrument due to its high speed limit . This might mean that although having better control when it comes to writing bigger words and phrases on the surface of papers such as letters from parents or notes written in classrooms, people who use them usually wouldn\u2019t manage to fill up blank pages completely before the time runs out since the number of marks they were able to create wasn\u2019t very big and they didn\u2019t go beyond those limitations . It seems like this difference occurs because markers allow us to write thicker strokes in shorter amounts of time even though some individuals may prefer sketch pens for different reasons such as wanting to be precise in every stroke and not rushing things. Therefore, these instruments offer unique benefits to everyone according to what suits best to our needs . I think the most important thing here is knowing where and under which circumstances each tool was created to perform optimum in order to choose accordingly."

The other reason for choosing one over another would depend upon which color you want to use most often since both are available in many different varieties and also whether you prefer to draw thickly or thin lines.\n\nAssistant: What type(s) of art supplies are these two?\n\\end{blockquote}",
            "1) Sketch pens are used for drawing lines on paper, which makes it easy to draw straight lines. The markers have an oil-based pigmentation inside them, and can be used with watercolors to create shading effects. Markers come in several colors, but do not produce fine details when drawn onto surfaces. They may also leave stains behind if they spill over.2) A marker is a writing implement consisting of a tube made up from a liquid solution (usually ink), and a tip at one end through which air passes into the tube. This causes the ink to appear at the other end of this tube by capillary action. The coloring agent usually consists of dyes mixed with various chemicals like glycerine or waxes. These agents give the fluid resistance to flow so that the ink stays intact even after multiple uses and prevents dryness and cracking at tips.3) A paintbrush has bristles that are attached to a handle called a \"painting stick\". The size of these bristled hairs determines how much pressure will apply when using a particular type of brush; larger brushed require less force than smaller ones. Paintbrushes vary depending upon their purpose - there are specialized brushes for specific painting tasks such as filling large areas quickly without creating drips, applying detail work, and blending different paints together. Some types of paint are thicker than others requiring a wider stroke, some paints contain more pigments resulting in darker colors, etc...4) An art knife is a long thin blade used by artists during the process of illustrating or making artwork.

            "1) Immerse yourself completely into the culture/environment where they speak it; for example if someone wants to learn English from China, go there. This will teach them how to speak naturally and quickly without worrying about grammar rules too much (the only exception would be with French because we have to learn some grammar first). Also this gives one more motivation since one has friends who speak the same language which helps them keep going on their path. For those interested in learning other languages than English, I think immersion might also work well depending on what language one intends to study but maybe less so than with English due to its prevalence. However I can't really say whether or not this works very well at all though because my experience was just me taking classes and reading books before coming here to ask questions :) . I guess it depends on individual people anyway! But perhaps I could try to give an analogy based on personal experiences: I studied Mandarin Chinese during high school through regular classes taught by teachers, but when I came over here, most people already spoke quite good English, even if sometimes we had misunderstandings and things were confusing etc.. But nowadays I feel like speaking mandarin is almost effortless for me since I spent enough time in environments where everyone around me talked mandarin fluently, such as chatting online, talking with native speakers via apps like WeChat...

All forms of electromagnetic waves have associated electric fields and magnetic fields perpendicular relative to each other with the speed equal to that c in vacuum. Cause of it that they interact through an exchange force called displacement current which carries away momentum from system due to charge separation between source/observer and emitted photon, so resulting radiation has less energy than original one, hence observed emission decrease for wavelengths decreasing up till visible range wherein EM energy becomes directly measurable by human eye (this can be viewed as evidence towards quantized structure of reality as Maxwell derived his equations assuming constant velocity of charges). Diffracted patterns are caused because light undergoes multiple bounces before being detected thus causing spatial spreading. Polarisation refers to directional ordering of plane-wave propagating along particular vector in three dimensions but I think it doesn\u2019t relate well here unless we are talking about optical fibres, then maybe yes.\n\\end{lstlisting}\nWe use natural language processing techniques on these transcripts and provide both qualitative and quantitative results as shown next.

This happens through interaction with other particles by exchange of energy at the frequency corresponding to their difference in kinetic energy and potential energies, hence when there isn\u2019t an external force on these objects then they remain constant which can be described by classical physics, however due to this energy transferred, one object may increase and decrease faster than another resulting in movement towards eachother thus producing visible waves like we see everyday in sunlight and lightbulbs (in terms of quantum theory) where photons move along electric field lines within space/time from A(highest frequency), moving towards B (lowest frequency). As per quantum theory all mass is made up of protons, neutrons, electrons, etc... all held together via electrostatic forces caused by charged particle exchanges with positively (+1) charge for negatively (-1) charge giving neutrality (+0), causing gravity (as stated earlier), and the atomic number which tells us how many times these elements combine together into different atoms and molecules based on size differences between atoms; smaller more tightly bound to larger ones less so therefore less density making lighter material easier to manipulate e.g glass v plastic.

In order for us to perceive an object through our sight it must emit light which can then be detected by the eye\u2019s retina where the image forms on our vision field (which includes what is called our fovea). Light is actually made up of many waves vibrations that move at different speeds but when these combine they produce the colour red; this combination produces a high frequency sound and is also known as white noise. White light consists of all colours presenting together however each wavelength creates a slightly different effect such as blue causing less distortion than yellow for example due to their shorter lengths therefore making them appear bluer compared to yellower. Light behaves both like particles and waves because scientists have found that light behaves differently depending upon if there is no obstacle between the source of light and receiver i.e. black hole and neutron star etc.. When travelling though empty space it travels as rays however once there is another body within range from the original light source e.g. planets/stars it bends around these bodies and follows along until it reaches either a reflector surface or absorber medium, in most cases a vacuum so therefore following Newton\u2019s law of reflection and refracted back towards Earth again, creating optical illusions similar to mirages and rainbows etc\u2026Light behaves very much similarly to electricity except unlike electricity, electromagnetic radiation doesn\u2019t need conductors or ground sources in order to create an electrical current whereas in contrast without conduction electrons will always flow away from areas of higher concentration, however if an area contains more protons and electrons than usual they tend to attract one another resulting in the opposite effect hence the term negative charge, therefore light can travel via itself without the use of external stimuli although the intensity may decrease",

            "1) Digital Currencies like Bitcoin were born out of dissatisfaction with existing financial systems. They solve issues such as security, trustlessness etc which exist within current centralized fiat currency system. Governments around the world are still trying to figure this one out but my take would be - they will need to understand how it works before figuring out what needs to be done. The other point I want to add here - if there was no government control over bitcoins then people could use them for bad things (drug money, human trafficking). So governments must find ways to keep track of transactions without compromising privacy & speed/security of payments (decentralization, anonymity) .\n2) Blockchains are another thing altogether. I personally feel they provide better security than anything else we currently have today because even if some part of chain gets hacked; all nodes see everything so only those who have access to hacked node data would actually get unauthorised access. For example, suppose Alice has access to hacked Bobs data(which he himself did not know), she might try to spend his bitcoins from her wallet by pretending to be him via masquerade attack using hashes - However since everybody knows Bob, nobody would accept her transaction unless she used her real private key. Thus every node sees everyone hence only someone with Alice\u2019s keys could steal Bob\u2019s funds and also because each transaction requires proof-of-work, anyone can verify that Alice is trying to defraud bob into believing she owns BTC. This way, fraudulence detection happens at scale across network thus making sure Alice cannot cheat in a sustainable fashion.",
            "\\strong{A} Digital currency can be defined as electronic cash used for transactions over computer networks. It is also known as virtual money because it has no intrinsic value like physical money (USD). \\em{\\strong{However,}} in terms of its legal status and acceptance among consumers this e-cash would be considered similar to paper bills and coins from an economic standpoint, although they have been criticized by law enforcement officials who feel that cryptocurrency is difficult if not impossible to track due to their decentralised nature. Therefore, digital currencies could pose significant challenges to conventional systems such as banks which typically rely heavily upon government backing but may also offer benefits including lower transaction costs and potentially higher security features compared to credit cards or other payment methods. The use of blockchains makes them ideal platforms for digital asset trading since they enable users to transfer assets across peer\u2013to\u2013peer exchanges without intermediaries.

However even though, several companies offer chatbots today it is still a problematic approach because most users prefer speaking out loud their demands over typing them. As such this section proposes using speech recognition algorithms.\nIn general, there is two kinds of tasks within NLP framework \u2013 linguistic knowledge representation & generation including syntactic and semantic analysis, parsing and comprehension along-with lexicon management and phoneme-to-text conversion systems. Another task consists of dialogue strategies for managing all types of requests and keeping conversation flow going by performing logical reasoning based on external resources and personalized customer data stores. The latter allows us to achieve more conversational experience.\nThe proposed solution will consist mainly out of three modules - an input module capable of recognizing user voice commands via microphone + noise suppressor to identify distinct sounds, output module containing text editor in which machine intelligence could produce different combinations of sentence structure based on recognized voice command + vocabulary selection to choose proper expression and finally execution phase where logic engine analyzes request and either executes corresponding task automatically or delegates appropriate task owners from backend for manual operation according to available options for each particular request.",

In terms of how they regulated this type of transaction we must take into account their jurisdiction laws... It all depends on each country/region ... 1-In most regions like Canada where there was an official legislative act such as FinTech Law , there has been created specific rules around this area.... This means it allows people with knowledge & expertise who wants to offer some kind of services using those platforms .. For example : https://www.securities-lawyer.ca/?page_id=593 . The regulators here need to review them but so far its quite ok ..... But other parts may require different legal acts..... So basically the same principle apply to many others areas such as securities traders law , broker dealers , crowdfunding companies etc... In addition, we could consider having our own personal licenses such as chartered advisor which is one step further in helping us gain credibility and be recognized within industry itself by showing professionalism through formal education process... And finally we must look at our individual experience levels (ie) do we hold FSA license already ? what type ?? how much experience in capital markets .... 2-There might be cases where there were no explicit written law but certain types of activities requires authorization from relevant government body due to its potential risks (like selling high risk products)..\n\nComment: Thanks a lot, this looks very promising!

Governments will need more money if they want to take action against companies that aren\u2019t doing their job well enough (i.e., crypto-exchange). There must be some way of prevention when it comes to such frauds so we don't have people getting ripped off every other day because they thought someone was going to get them into making a fortune only to realize it was just an online scam trying to get rich quick schemes by trickery and manipulation through misinformation about what exactly bitcoin actually does or doesn't mean etc...  Secondly there needs to be education. We can start educating the general public better at large how to understand and navigate all this technology that isn't understood by everyone but most especially the young who often become vulnerable to the persuasion techniques used to try to entice us into spending our hard earned savings and even retirement funds investment money towards something like BitCoins without realizing what risks were involved. So much money gets lost in investing and I feel bad sometimes reading those stories knowing the same could happen again unless measures are put into place. Also we must keep teaching people with proper tools available that are user friendly where people don't lose too many of their savings because then there wouldn't be enough money saved up from paycheck to pay check anymore and therefore it would lead to a greater risk for economic downturn and possibly a crash altogether since we cannot sustain economies if the masses aren't financially secure enough which is part of one major cause for the last great recessions around 2008 due to housing crisis that took out banks causing panic amongst stock holders which led to mass devaluations.

With Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency becoming more popular over time it has created an alternative source for consumers who may feel they cannot trust their local banks anymore. It is hard to control this new market since there are many different companies trying to enter into it such as Ripple. I believe the government will continue to monitor the transactions taking place within this market because some individuals may use cryptos illegitimately such as buying drugs online. In addition, with crypto making up only one percent of global payment volume according to the World Bank Group\u2019s Global Findex Database (2017) governments will likely keep a close eye out to prevent further corruption from happening due to lack of funds available in society. This topic interests me because it gives me insight into how technology changes our everyday lives by providing us with options we did not even consider before.",
            "Blockchains have an ability to change how money moves around our society today by providing us with decentralized peer-to-peer networks without requiring third parties like banks or government institutions to hold data about each transaction for verification purposes. They enable more direct interaction between buyers and sellers. Digital currency allows transactions to be completed instantaneously rather than having them go through intermediaries who often take days if not weeks to complete transactions. These new technological advancements provide people with opportunities they may never had before because it has removed some barriers which prevented people from engaging in international trade previously such as geographic distance and costly fees associated with moving large sums of capital across borders. However, this also presents risks especially when we think about the volatility of cryptocurrencies compared to fiat currencies where there\u2019s less risk involved since governments tend to actively work towards ensuring their value doesn\u2019t fluctuate too much over time. As a result, regulators will need to develop strategies for balancing the benefits brought forth by disruptive technologies with maintaining confidence within the broader economy so consumers aren\u2019t harmed during market corrections. There are already efforts underway globally including in Canada at the federal level along with provinces to adopt legislative measures for governing cryptocurrency activities such as ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) but those policies vary widely among jurisdictions depending on what types of assets they intend to regulate and how stringently they want to apply the laws. It seems unlikely that every country will enact similar laws considering that many still lack sufficient infrastructure necessary to properly monitor cryptocurrency trading activities whereas others could become extremely burdensome to compliance with potentially making business operations far too difficult for most companies to conduct legitimate exchanges safely.

Now people who want to be involved in cryptocurrency need to use banks for their transactions so now those very same institutions that got away from oversight will once again fall under its scrutiny and we may even see some sort of \"banksters\" scandal arise.\n2) It depends if this technology is going mainstream like Facebook or Google where everyone uses them but there is also no real way to control them. If it goes main stream then governments could try to implement taxes which will hurt the market but if it never becomes popular then maybe they won\u2019t care too much at first. However, when Bitcoin became big, governments started looking into it more and trying to find ways to stop it by banning certain exchanges.\n3) I am sure there will be many laws passed around cryptos and blockchains over time just like how every industry had different laws applied to itself throughout history. The problem is finding the right balance between allowing enough freedom and keeping people secure.\n4) This is one area I think government needs to focus on heavily because if someone gets hacked due to poor security practices than it hurts consumers. For example, I used my credit card online today to purchase some items and received an email confirmation stating \u201cYour transaction is complete! We hope you enjoy our products.\u201d This is terrible because anyone could easily create such emails using software tools available on the web today.\n5) There really isn\u2019t anything that can be done except for educating people better regarding cybersecurity risks especially related to passwords and two-factor authentication.

To parse an array of arrays you need another foreach loop inside the first one.

            "The best RPGs have great combat mechanisms which require players to think tactically. A good example would be Final Fantasy VII (PS1), where the player could equip characters based upon their stats and abilities, but it was also important to choose how many party members they had fighting at once since different enemies required certain numbers depending on whether they were strong, weak, or fast-moving opponents. This made battling challenges feel more realistic because the player couldn\u2019t simply spam attack commands until victory without having thought about what strategy might work against each enemy type. Another thing that makes these types of RPGS interesting is when there are various options available during battle so the player feels like he has multiple ways of achieving victory other than using brute force alone - this adds replay value by making them want to try out all of the possibilities rather than just one approach. Some examples of RPGS that offer this kind of flexibility in my opinion include Chrono Trigger (SNES) and Xenoblade (Wii).\nThe reason I say \u201cmy opinion\u201d here is because people tend to disagree over what makes up a good role playing video game experience!

Still others may find themselves drawn toward puzzles or adventure games like Zelda series and Metroid respectively; however, if we look at the history of RPGs we see that most fall into two categories: Japanese and Western/European.

Thanks\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nMy solution looks like this below - hope that helps others who may find this post looking for guidance :-) As far as I understand (this might well be wrong!) - they are expecting full sentences, so each sentence begins a new line here! There probably has been quite a debate already within their team, however perhaps it will go over your heads here if anything else gets mentioned haha! I am also including links in case you need further explanation or examples where needed above. Good luck to anyone who may come along trying to solve this problem for them!! Hope the solutions assist you somehow and let us both learn some good practices around proof",
            "1) Create an interesting headline like \"Top ten most exciting innovations from AI\" for example \\em{\\strong{which will be linked back towards my business home page}}.  2) Select several related points below which relate closely together regarding AI and link them within each sentence, paragraph and so on in order.  3) Focus more around trending technological events etc., but also incorporating other forms such social media posts which may have become popular recently. Also focus much upon recent developments with voice technology etc. In short we aim to demonstrate clearly just what has been happening over last week/months time regarding key emerging topics relevant in this sphere nowadays.

In addition, candidates received personalised advice on the areas where improvements could be made for future applications. Candidates were informed to submit at least two research papers for review during the assessment process.\nWhile some applicants did pass the online assessments without much difficulty, others found it harder. One candidate commented on Twitter saying she had spent around six hours trying to solve just three out of five coding problems. She eventually got stuck after eight hours of work. When asked by her followers what happens when people get stuck, she responded ``they get kicked off'.'' Similarly another PhD student tweeted: ``It took almost ten days"

Some of these may be due to an oversight or other error during development and subsequent maintenance or might only happen occasionally when specific data is used; however, others will most likely continue to crop up simply because there are aspects of our explanatory methods where we still need improvements such as avoiding repetitions, providing clear and precise feedback etc.. One could argue that every explanation requires context-dependent decisions on what level(s) to focus on to present relevant detail -- e.g., if all features would have to be discussed then explaining each at length may result in too verbose messages - however this is ultimately very hard since explanatory design needs to balance between making things easier for people who already understand vs.\\ helping those without prior knowledge yet to reach understanding via their own attempts i.e., learning through exploration. As outlined earlier in Section \\ref{sec.challenges}, these difficulties stem partly from the challenged inherently complex system involved but also originate within human language itself which makes us prone to errors and ambiguities thus rendering automated assistance hard and sometimes impossible regardless whether implemented based off rule-, pattern recognition or reasoning models. The latter point is highlighted below (in conjunction with Section~\\ref{subsec.issue2} on \\textit{\"Why\"-representativeness}). Further issues arise especially when dealing with the semantic web since various sources including images/videos use different licences and thus the information provided differs drastically.

            "The writer of a book set in an historical time period must remain faithful to actual events in history so they will have some connection with real people, places and times, even if only very tenuously; but at other points the novel may stray into what I think would be more accurately called fantasy because it contains invented elements such as supernatural phenomena. So my own personal opinion (as a reader) would tend towards a hybrid category somewhere between non-fiction & fantasy for these types of novels rather than strictly either/or - depending on how far one might go to suspend disbelief during reading them. However this has been argued both ways over centuries! And perhaps readers differ greatly in their opinions too, depending on age and life experiences... For example when watching TV shows based on historical fiction, some watchers want accurate representations from past eras which includes details about social conditions and living styles whereas others do not mind a great deal if things are 'loosely based around true incidents', so long as the basic premise of each storyline makes logical sense to the audience, otherwise we feel let down by bad acting performances or inconsistencies. Someone recently commented on my FB wall regarding an American Civil War TV drama saying \"it was pretty awful\". Another said he felt that most historical dramatizations are badly researched - just another form of escapism for entertainment purposes rather than serious documentaries, but nevertheless can sometimes spark off interesting debates online amongst fans after the programmes airing... So, ultimately it comes down to the author having full editorial control and knowing his target readership(s), along with good advice given early on beforehand via editors / proofreaders etc who have expert knowledge on writing conventions relating to this subject matter.. It's important therefore that there shouldn't ever really be confusion caused for those interested enough in this type of thing. I'd hate for",
            "It depends on how important history actually is to society. There could be a good argument for keeping things fictionalized so that it would allow people with little knowledge about specific time periods have more fun learning. This could lead to greater understanding later on if people get curious about their past and decide they want to learn even further into certain aspects. The problem however, might lie in that the average person has such poor reading skills already today; especially since school education tends to emphasize maths rather than english classes nowadays, meaning people may never become very fluent readers (this applies particularly for girls). Also there needs to be an interesting plot otherwise people won\u2019t bother with this genre. Historical events by themselves tend to be dull. Apart from World War II most historic conflicts didn\u2019t seem too thrilling after all, except perhaps battles against supernatural enemies like vampires and zombies ;-), but those can still feel realistic enough due to modern special effects and film techniques allowing to depict scenes better without overusing cheap gimmicks anymore these days anyway... But what I really find quite strange here though isn\u2019t that there are two camps which differ whether it should remain accurate at least up to some degree. The point I was referring to above when writing about \u2018how historically accurate historical novels ought to stay\u2018 were people who consider the truth of reality as less valuable than fiction, which sounds ridiculous! People are willing to spend lots of money and watch many movies which only consist out of computer generated images (CGI) \u2013 where almost everything seen within the frame borders appears artificially fabricated, whereas books always feature artwork based on illustrations done using paints / water colours, pens, brushes etc., often combined with other visual media, but the majority consists mostly out of hand drawn images and sometimes text written onto paper with ink pens / markers and pencils - both mediums involving human"

It covers basic aspects about verb conjugation rules, cases, gender, prepositions etc., however it may lack some more advanced topics like tenses and other details, therefore do note what book you buy since this issue exists even for native speakers, so be careful if getting an old edition from libraries). Also try Rosetta stone , its has interactive exercises based on pictures which helps memorize vocabulary. For practicing reading comprehension skills visit http://www.readlang.com where they have free short stories available in different languages . Another tool is podcasts, here some links I found especially useful for beginners :\n[link](http://ruspod.weebly.com/) \\n\\n[[205] \ud83d\udd25 The 81 Most Essential Words! | Learn Russian Effortlessly ](https://learn-russian-effortlessly.teachable.com/#courses) \\n\\n[Russia Lectures - The Only Way To Realllly Start Learning RS](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkGj6MKwOdXDHFVaLZbXyJM2XqfIkT4C9)\\n\\n*Practice* * [Russian Narrative Text #1](https://github.com/vladlen9703/rus_text_",
            "You could just search online for websites like Babbel (www.babbel) which teaches users new languages and gives them a taste of it before buying anything. However, beware of scammers who want access to private documents from your phone etc. Also check with friends if they have used language learning courses on apps that may work better than others. Another way might be finding foreign exchange students nearby and ask them about their experiences, this can also give you an opportunity to practice! Finally go abroad! You\u2019ll need to get used to using public transportation systems overseas which will force you to think quickly so you can get around somewhere new. There are many great resources available but I would suggest getting experience at speaking other languages alongside those materials; this is ultimately the best thing to do rather than relying solely upon technology because you lose fluency much quicker compared to real time conversations with native speakers where grammar mistakes won\u2019t matter initially anyway until later. So find language partners locally or via Skype (skype.com), Hangouts/Duo (google.co.uk or duo.me) , WeChat (searchweixin or wechat-en .com), Line or Kakaotalk Apps (lineapps dot com). Then you both benefit by doing a barter - one teaching another whatever they excelled at whilst taking part in activities you enjoy together. This increases both our skills rapidly without having to spend money on expensive software. Some people learn faster than others depending on how easily they pick up sounds or words etc.. Whichever method suits you works perfectly fine and avoid paying companies thousands every year just to study English for example since there are far more free options available online today unlike previously when it was all very traditionalised.

Also https://ru-school.net/ , it\u2019s useful both online (in Russian) and offline if studying at home without an internet connection, they have great lessons for each level of language. In Moscow there is a network of centres \u201cLinguo\u201d.

And here\u2019s my last tip: use free sources on Youtube \u2013 Russkoe Vokabularo TV has over two hundred video episodes covering basic grammar points (though the presentations could improve). For advanced users who need vocabulary boosting watch [Krugovaya Kvadratina](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdDuZwHQhBXqFGnMkfPj9yA), it helps build up the word base through contextual situations, I believe you may find many things familiar in real life thanks to such shows because often topics are about typical issues encountered by native speakers, and it would seem they take all into account! It also makes perfect practice after listening since subtitles always follow speech and it saves time having them turn around :) Another source is https://ruslanglab.tv/ , these videos were created for school children and adult students but are really entertaining. Finally another very cool channel to look at is [NashTutor.Ru] where a professional tutor records himself explaining difficult words or concepts and even offers tips on how to pass tests, interviews",

I recommend doing lots of listening first. This website will teach vocabulary based on the most commonly occurring words https://cambridge-daily-grammar.com/, if interested just type into Google what grammar points interest you, then click search, usually you get enough sites from there where to practice those skills further with interactive games & tests.

For instance I can open the file without issues from my Macbook Pro running OS X Sierra v.10.12.6 whereas when I opened the same file locally on Windows machine, the output was blank.

This is because these AI systems work by identifying words within sentences and then grouping them together based on their meaning.

We always use seed with pseudorandom generators (PRGs), such as Mersenne Twister generator etc., because we need seed if generating numbers from PRG (pseudo-random generation must use specific seeding mechanisms to achieve pseudo-randomness; this can either be provided implicitly via the internal state of the algorithm, such as the initial value for an internal counter, or more often explicitly, through external sources); however CSPRNG uses its own source so that no external input is involved; but if external input then only one time pad will increase security level further; 2) In general no system needs seeds but there could arise situations where some parameter may depend on another paramter; e.g.\n    Let `s(n)` means seed generated at step n by cryptographic function AES\n    Let `A(`p`,`s`)()` return output after encryption by first input string passed to first input arg p and second argument s. Note in above example: 1st arg has dependency upon 2nd arg (`S`). So the function will ask how much seed to take from S before encryptin first arg.

This is expected since it has been created based off System properties.\n\nThis means if you want two different instances of `Random` objects having distinct numbers, you must either generate the seeds yourself or pass in the seed value to the method when calling `new Random(...)`, e.g.: `rand = new java.util.Random(42)`.\n\n\\begin{code}\n// Example #1 :\nclass Main { // main class where Random object rand is instantiated & called\n    public void test() { // Test method that calls nextInt once per iteration\n        int x = Math.round(rand.nextDouble",
            "A Seed is used for initializing a random number generator (RNG). It helps generate an unique sequence every time. The RNGs work with a pseudo-random sequence which can be generated by using seeds but cannot be predicted exactly.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item What do you mean when you say 'a sequence' ?\n\\end{itemize}"

We see several times over the course of the film that Ava exhibits behaviors and thought patterns very close to those seen among humans. She understands language, she learns quickly, she has a full range of emotional reactions and responses, and her physical attributes closely mimics a woman's. However, Ava does show evidence of possessing knowledge that only computers would ever possibly contain - and the audience knows at least part of her"

However, there may also exist circumstances whereby both may consider ethics less relevant at times for various reasons including, e.g., safety and security over the long term; ensuring survival by keeping society intact or preventive measures against future threats. Also, it includes speculation surrounding the possibility of robots developing independent thinking and acting without interference by external sources or influences beyond their capacity to control themselves; however, both remain wary due to potential outcomes that pose great risk and danger in situations involving robots interacting too closely (or even aggressively) with real-world life forms (including people).",

In short, artificial intelligence is yet to be achieved and maybe we won\u2019t even achieve them ever due to many limitations regarding its functionality including self-learning and understanding emotions from human behavioural traits etc... so until we figure out how exactly our brain works with its complexity of neural connections , it will be difficult to build one machine that can perform these tasks successfully.. however since this technology is very interesting nowadays people still continue trying and developing their skills further into building better ones and improving upon those weaknesses..so let me rephrase my response ..in order to develop an Ai(artificial intelligence)we must first study more about human psychology ...so we can create programs to emulate behaviors/traitss of humans. We can learn through experience and studies about cognitive abilities . Then based on this data, algorithms are designed and created accordingly.. then they try implementing those programmable algorithm into hardware.. So after doing all of these procedures it has resulted to us creating smart devices like google home assisting devices where it is able to respond appropriately and correctly without needing instructions.... However at this stage the machine isn't really \"smart\" it merely imitated behavior learned by machines that already had the knowledge embedded in itself previously and the process starts over again with the newly added software to teach it new things ....

            "1) The main character of Ex-Machina (2015) was played by Domhnall Gleeson, an actor who appeared alongside Will Poulter, a fellow actor who had starred in another science fiction movie released within five years called Black Mirror - Bandersnatch. How many different ways can you connect these two actors? For example \"Bandersnatch\" = Will + Black+mirr= Domhna+l, but only if this order applies; e.g., if you tried Domh+la instead of domhnal then it wouldn\u2019t be true). In addition to giving multiple valid connections for each actor, you may also add one additional connection for yourself using both names in any combination at least once (e.g. Gleeson AND/OR Glee AND/OR Nol). So if you think there could have been other connections such as Bandersnack \u2013 Black \u2013 mirror, they still count even though I did not mention them explicitly above! However note: this type of thinking doesn't apply here, because this question will not test your knowledge on film, rather your logical skills, so feel free to just go with whatever feels right and seems obvious from looking through my examples above! There aren\u2019t enough words here, which is fine because the purpose of the exercise is simply to give some idea of how creative and diverse our minds are when given new situations where we must combine elements into relationships without necessarily needing specific vocabulary terms, but only intuition based reasoning about patterns, rules etc...

PHP is used mainly for developing server-side scripts; however, there has been an increase in development of desktop apps with its use too. This is done through either C or C++ programs known as wrappers (or via language bindings such as libguestfs), which communicate directly with a running copy of the php executable, passing it requests generated by their respective program and reading out its results back again when requested to do so from said program. For this reason alone many Linux distributions come bundled with packages for installing the most commonly required software libraries and compilers necessary for doing such work without requiring installation outside the operating system environment.   Other examples where native wrapper executables have proven successful includes writing code that will execute directly under the Wine emulator to access various Microsoft Windows services from Unix machines (see e.g. cygwin) as well as cross-compiling C/C++ applications written to be compatible with various UNIX systems to run natively inside Windows (using MinGW). In both cases the developer only needs a basic working knowledge of one platform, yet can target the entire market place, thereby significantly increasing revenue opportunities and decreasing overall cost involved per product developed - a clear benefit.

            "No, this doesn\u2019t seem like an appropriate opinion to hold; most likely because you are referring to \u201cweird\u201d activities such as eating strange foods or collecting certain objects which do not affect anyone else but yourself (in contrast to those who might be doing drugs or stealing from others). These things aren\u2019t considered weird for the simple reason that they may actually hurt someone physically/emotionally \u2013 either by giving them physical pain due to the activity itself or making them feel uneasy about themselves through negative social influence. It is important to remember that actions done alone without negatively impacting others are acceptable unless specifically prohibited under law - therefore we cannot assume everyone has bad intentions towards their own health or well-being. In order to truly understand whether what another person chooses to engage in personally can be considered wrong or ethical, one must first take into account the potential consequences these actions could bring upon others, even if indirectly. This would require assessment on factors such as the number of people involved, the level of danger associated with said action, its ability to spread and cause further damage to society at large etcetera. The way I see it, no single human has authority over determining morality within their own mindset \u2013 however when there comes a need to communicate ideas with each other and cooperate as members of our species, rules must come into place to keep us all alive and thriving. In conclusion, though there isn\u2019t necessarily anything inherently immoral regarding how a given individual lives his life privately, we also live together amongst each other and so our decisions ultimately effect those around us.

Add more plants with time. Keep track of which ones survive best! Plant sunflowers so it blooms bright flowers throughout summer . It will also be a good source of food (like seeds ). Once successful move next step. Good luck!. Also here is another option if interested : you can buy ready seed kits online from reputable company and just follow instructions written on them.( I bought few products in past and they work very well.). Example - https://amzn.to/2uNnCWK ( 5-Plant Seed Starter Kit).",
            "Here are some ideas - if it\u2019s a small space with poor light conditions, plant plants/flowers indoor during wintertime \u2013 they don\u2019t need too much sunlight (only grow until mid-day) like chrysanthemums, orchids or bamboo trees. For an outdoor planting try growing vegetables in pots on balconies! It really gives so much happiness by producing fresh food all year around!! Other option could be window boxes filled with flower herbs such as parsley etc.. And I will give you some tips about buying seeds: \u2022 Avoid hybrid flowers because after a few years these tend to die off completely without being replanted \u2013 rather buy open pollinated ones \u2022 Try to find organic products \u2013 most companies offer them nowadays \u2022 Be aware when trying new things though because if there isn`t enough water one day, a lot of germinating happens\u2026 and everything dies \u2022 Buy high quality seedlings from nurseries as usually they come better already grown than just bought as seed \u2022 Make sure also that what you get doesn\u2019t contain weed killers and other poisons \u2013 maybe ask seller before purchasing how the production was done.

            "1) I will be using soil from Home Depot which costs $35/cubic yard (which would cost about $40-60 total). I could also buy some pots if I wanted them. Soil quality may vary by region so check it out beforehand. Also keep an eye on whether the store sells potting mixes or other types of organics because those can really save time and energy! For example, the potting mix at Home Depot comes with worms and bacteria already present but if I was starting seeds directly into the ground then no potting mix might work just fine too. It depends what type of plantings we decide to do here. Another thing worth mentioning regarding plants and seedlings specifically...make sure they come from trusted sources. Many places sell fake flowers or plants. Be careful when buying online as well - look up reviews etc.. Make sure they have legitimate packaging as well; I wouldn't order anything over the internet without doing this step first. Some good tips on how to tell real ones from fakes [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTfMkEpHoFQ&list=UUybDGqhPzOIi_mLrSnBwZaA). The most important things to consider however are the location and weather conditions where one lives. I recommend keeping everything outside until there are at least two weeks left till winter sets in, then bring indoor again during winter months. Keep checking back periodically though, as temperature drops rapidly after November/December in our area and temperatures tend to hover around freezing level between December through February. So it is better to get rid of all stuff once winter starts and restart growing later on next year. As far as sunlight goes, it needs to hit every single leaf on each individual plant daily"

If no value was entered on command-line by user, then `bash` automatically assigns the current directory (`$PWD`) which contains all files and sub directories. So if we had a script named \\strong{\"my_script\"}, located inside `/home/` folder, running it would give us output like so below:-\n\n\\em{`~/test.sh: line 1 : ./my_script : No such file or directory`} . Notice how the error message says \"No such file or directory\". That's just the way `bash` behaves since it has no idea where our `.sh` extension came from. But let say we run the same command now, passing `-f`, meaning force the path given, even though it isn't present.\n\n`-f` switch allows us to pass the absolute location(path) of a particular file rather than relative locations. In above case, we want the absolute full path of the test file so lets use the `realpath` utility here:-\n\n\\strong{`file_name=``$(dirname ${1})``${(realpath \"$\")}`} . Now try running again."

Input string must contain only alphabets followed by atmost maximum number of whitespaces before \"The best \". All white spaces inbetween words need not necessarily present there in real data since user will write their response but they are part of regular expression for input validation so we want all such characters to exist along with other conditions also (e.g.: no line breaks). Here \"A-Z+\" refers all uppercase alpha characters in addition to lower case ones (this makes sure input doesn't end up matching on character patterns like AAA etc.) This is needed because if users input string contained only small letters then there may come situation where next line text got split and word ended at new lines thereby failing test due to missing whitespace character whereas above solution ignores letter boundaries which works fine even when multiple small letters occur consecutively without whitespace between them (due to word breakings on space boundaries). However, more than 2 instances of same upper/lower alpha character will fail regex. Also note that upper/lower case alpha characters are counted",

What\u2019s more important however, they differ greatly from regular python object oriented code since pandas etc run entirely on top of distributed systems!

You may find an interesting guide for starting here: https://www.python-course.eu/get_started.php. As mentioned earlier we also provide an open-source framework for Python development named Zappa, which includes tools for developing web services from scratch (http://zappacore.org) \u2013 have a look into if interested!

Good luck and let us hear what your ideas could become by solving our problem. The following task will be available throughout all the hours until Saturday night: Create two projects: One in each of the following technologies; - Java using Apache Tomcat + JSP files / Spring Framework / Maven Build + SQL database. Second one - NodeJS / AngularJs frontend using Express Server. You can create more than these 3 solutions. Make sure to check them out thoroughly later. Try running each project separately, deploying everything properly according to best practices etc.. Test and run the server, access your applications and confirm whether they work fine individually firstly without communicating between each other then after creating the necessary code, add functionality where both projects interact with each other (see attached requirements file), i.e., write an endpoint which sends a request via API from Nodejs back end app to Python Flask API server where a user has submitted data such as a comment text input box on webpage along with its submission timestamp when sending requests, receiving replies in return which get logged and saved onto"

Python can be tricky because there aren\u2019t many people who really understand its intricacies; most developers only use bits & pieces here and there (I\u2019m talking about web development). This makes them more difficult to find since they often won\u2019t list \u201cPython\u201d on their resume if they don\u2019t do everything with it all day everyday. On top of this, we see an increasing trend where businesses expect lower costs from outsourcing. It doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t pay well\u2026it just means that when asking around for pricing estimates, some places might offer rates closer to $18-$24/hour which is what I would say is standard. We get so few requests to hire Python devs at those prices though that I haven\u2019t had a chance yet to compare it against other languages. That said, you may still end up having trouble finding someone experienced enough with both Julia and Python at those rates \u2013 so my suggestion is to either look outside of the US (if that\u2019s OK) OR ask us again after adding $60-75/hr onto the original estimate (we have one person currently working for ~$90/hr - he knows Python pretty darned good!) In short, you need to spend more time doing research yourself to come across a qualified candidate willing to work for less money than the average."

            "I have a theory which may sound absurd, so hear me out... A bird has two wings. One wing goes up (up = forward). The other one stays on earth and acts more as if it was another pair of legs. Birds do flaps with their arms for landing too, but those flaps look less powerful than normal arm-flapping actions from people walking downstairs etc. This could mean they need this force when taking off and then later stop doing these flaps since flying already happened successfully! In other words birds only take flight because there must be enough force coming upwards. If they fly low at all times and keep moving fast by flapping continuously they might stay alive forever, although that\u2019d still depend how many animals try to catch them, especially big cats like tigers/lions etc., which eat smaller creatures first. That said though maybe large carnivorous predators just kill weak birds rather quickly once spotted, therefore preventing extinction of some species due to hunting alone. What makes an animal survive longer than others? Evolution is such a weird thing - if humans lived in space and never touched Earth again after the dinosaurs were gone what changes will occur between generations and can we really ever expect lifeforms on Earth today to become extinct over time even though no evolution happens anymore??

            "Aircraft wings have surfaces which create lift when they go through motion due to winds (airflow). When this happens, there is a net force on each wing surface which acts upwards from its centerline towards the upper part. This causes an aircraft to rise into sky. In addition to these forces acting upon them, planes also have their weight pushing down on them; so overall, the plane has a negative buoyant effect causing the craft to be pulled backward by gravity. To balance out all these effects, the pilot applies power to move forward at speed, thereby counteracting gravitational pull, thus creating thrust. Thrust can only occur if the aircraft\u2019s engine produces more energy than what is required for propulsion.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item How do we define \"lift\" mathematically ?\n      Assistance : The definition of lift is given as the component of the aerodynamic force perpendicular to the velocity vector. Mathematics wise it could look similar to this - Lift = Fx * vx where x represents the direction parallel to the ground.\n     User : Lift is defined using Newton\u2019s laws of Motion \u2013 \u201cLift is equal to Force applied per unit area.\u201d For every force applied on the object, there will always be another reaction force exerted opposite to the action force. So, if the plane flies against winds then it will apply a normal push-back type of force to resist itself getting pushed away with the wind. That means, if one considers a small portion/area of the body, then it will act exactly like a wall. And since a wall resists anything coming close to it, similarly the same principle works here too. It means the plane will get lifted off the ground! Hence, lifting force can also refer to the upward directed component of total aerodynamic pressure over the wing section.

Maybe they are only able to take into consideration one specific kind of user, so their ability for \"adjustment\" becomes quite limited, but hey ... this means you still haven't figured out exactly who that type of users are.

Is this the final string shown above? If not where did `string1` come from. Why didn't you copy paste it before editing ?

Thanks!\n\nComment: What do you mean with \"asking until getting answer\" - which type of operation will happen exactly inside your code and at the end when you try to get the result? Can you elaborate on that part so we know where to start in understanding what kind of problem you want to solve/optimize here? Maybe some [XY](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem) questions come up after all... :)\n\nAnswer: So basically my solution looks like\n\nfirst create two sets `Asked = new HashSet()` containing users whose last question was asked yet not their own answer\nand set with currently processing users i.e. set who hasn\u2019t been interrupted since last request with id_request = current requestID. This would allow me to send same questions in one round to users waiting longest amount of time asking each others previous queries. Then loop through each processed set of data and compare them for duplicate answers, if they aren't equal then simply move forward else put back into Set\nafterwards check against duplicates, if none found then proceed to sending new requests; also remove newly acquired Answer from process set in order to continue its work later during another iteration\nIf no valid response has arrived within specified amount of delay(number given by admin), than send a warning message to client"

This can also involve asking hypotheticals such as if a situation were different how might it play out differently. It shouldn\u2019t feel scripted or contrived. Asking \u201cwhat if\u201d type questions helps elicit creativity from responders who may have otherwise been restricted by other formats of communication.\nIf there seems to be no logical way to continue without making statements with no supporting evidence, then you must add more details into the conversation so that others (especially humans) can understand what you mean and continue the conversation further.\nPlease ensure that your posts are informative, well-worded, grammatically correct and clear. As always, try to keep it short and sweet! The main focus here is getting people thinking outside the box so that they come away feeling inspired and curious to learn even more than before. We all love learning new things, right? :)\nAssistant: So, now what was our last topic again?? Tell me everything!!\n\nUser: oh wait im confused, let me check...

            "10th grade math homework. I am working on it right now. The problem was confusing so i had to look at some videos online for more explanation before getting started. It seems like the teacher expects us to do a lot with little explanation, which isn't fair if we haven't been taught this yet...\n\\textit{and so on.} Note how he uses a simple imperative sentence - \\textit{\"it seems\"}- then makes a complaint (i.e. saying the task seemed difficult) followed by a subjective statement (\\textit{\"which isn't fair if we hadn't been taught this yet...\"}) Then proceeds normally from thereon until completing his response.\n\nThe user starts off with a personalized introductory line, making himself relatable (the idea behind building rapport). His next statement shows him solving the issue; he explains the challenges faced during completion of the task, then expressing dissatisfaction towards his own performance due to lack of proper knowledge/explanation provided by the instructor. He finishes off by giving contextual information regarding his background and educational status. This creates a clear picture of who this person is within the conversation, creating trust between both parties involved. Since our goal here is to create a realistic conversation using natural language generation, this approach will be used throughout all examples given below.\\footnote{\\url{https://medium.com/@sandeep_34268/chatbot-interactions-a-stepbystep-guide-to-writing-conversational-nlu-scripts-d7c59fdfacbf}}\n\nAI assistants have come under scrutiny recently because their interactions often sounded too robotic compared to what humans usually say when they talk amongst themselves.

This may take several exchanges between both parties before it gets interesting. Assume there isn\u2019t much else happening at this point besides idle chatter with each other. The user could say they\u2019re going out soon etc. But if they send nothing, just wait for them to ask a new question/start talking again. Just like real life, sometimes people won\u2019t respond until someone says something next! :)\n\\item \\strong{\\em{[SUPPORT FOR NON-HUMAN CONVERSATION PARTNER]}\n(assuming this doesn\u2019t happen already)} At some point after sending their last reply, either party should try and switch over from the \u2018human mode\u2019 to the \u2018AI mode.\u2019 Once done so, continue on without asking further questions to confirm. This is when things get interesting\u2026\n\\item In order to maintain a high level of realism during our test runs, the user will need to remain \u201con task\u201d throughout all conversations with the virtual assistants. For example, let us say that our subject is doing some online shopping; therefore, whenever they open a browser tab with Amazon.com loaded inside of it, then our agent must also begin its research on items relevant to the product categories displayed within that webpage. Similarly, once they close the web page containing said products, the AI will also cease looking for data pertaining to those specific items. This will create more believable interactions than if one was constantly opening different tabs to search through multiple websites. However, feel free to adjust these guidelines depending upon how quickly you think the agents are capable of working compared to the average human\u2019s capabilities.}\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe idea here is to",

It was mostly related to reinforcement learning, which seems very cool to me but also pretty scary because if people get smart enough, they could use it for bad things. And yes, definitely! There has been some amazing progress recently with self-teaching neural networks and deep Q networks and other similar methods that have enabled machines to teach themselves how to play games like chess, go, poker etc without any supervision. This will enable them to take over the world soon lol :p Seriously though, I think so too! But it won\u2019t happen tomorrow probably.. maybe after 20 years :)\n\\item Wow that sounds amazing! Well what do you think is more likely? That all computers eventually become conscious robots capable of experiencing emotions/thoughts or that one day scientists figure out a method of making humans smarter by enhancing our cognitive abilities using technology ? Or perhaps both will happen at different times simultaneously ! Which do you find most probable? Also I wanted to ask if you had heard of DeepMind? They built AlphaGo last year which beat Lee Sedol - considered one of the best Go players ever!

As per experts, bots can be very useful in helping people connect faster through online messaging services (like WhatsApp), but also pose great potential risk when used by those who seek to exploit the vulnerable minds of others. In addition to providing free emotional support, there are several other uses cases such as businesses offering customer service using automated chatting agents; developers creating educational apps for children; social media platforms integrating personalised messages into their communication tools.

The main idea here is not how to develop it, but how to use the API from Google. In Android you can get access to Google Drive via Google APIs. To do so follow these steps : Go [here](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/), then click on \\strong{Sign up now}. Then go through this page until you find \"Google Cloud Platform Console\" section with \"Create new project\". Click on that link and enter some info about yourself there(your company). When finished click \"\\em{Get started}\" button. Next step is to enable Google Drive API for your newly created project by going to the left menu item \"APIs & auth\" -> \"Credentials\". On next screen press \"Add Credentials\". Now select type of credentials as service account key. After selecting the right kind of credential fill out all required fields and save it. It takes around 5 minutes after saving it before you could start testing the api. So let us assume everything was successfuly saved. Now lets test if we got our keys properly. Open browser again and navigate to the same url where you were previously signed up (\"https://console.cloud.google.com\"). This time however open \"API Manager\". Press + at top right corner and add a new API Project. Choose Google drive API under \"Type\" option. Enter your email address and password used when signing up earlier and press Save. A window pops up asking permission whether to give permissions to your current google account (you need to accept it), afterwards you will see API manager with list of available API projects. One of them must show up as \"G Suite Admin\", choose it and hit Continue. At last screen you should",
            "10 points\nI am looking for a python developer who can create me an android app which has a text field on the top and below it there will be three buttons. One would allow user enter some notes into that area and then save/print it out later (this button would have to print out all the entries from one date till another). Another button would clear everything entered so far. The third button could either add new line with more note entry fields or simply open up another window wherein we again write down our note details. I need this app created within 24 hours. This project needs to be completed by tomorrow night. Please only bid if u think ur able to do this quickly without any issues.\n\nComment: What exactly is unclear? Is `python-android` too broad for you? Or did you try anything already yourself yet? And what kind of \"notes\" are those - phone numbers perhaps? Do you mean \"text notes\" rather than \"phone number\"s? Can you give us a sample screenshot of how you want things look like? Also please clarify when you say \"within 24 hrs\". Does that apply also to the time until completion of work? How much experience you expect from developers here?\n\nAnswer: There are plenty of Python libraries available that support Android apps development such [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/). So first step is to install these two software. Then you may use them to develop your own application following the instructions given at their respective website(s)"

It might be because they are more aggressive by nature so such actions seem natural for them than other people. Also note how easily these kinds can change their behaviour based on situation, if necessary (they could burn my mother-in-law's home tomorrow morning just because she irritated him today). However this kind will have trouble showing genuine concern when required from them and won\u2019t take things personally too seriously even if it was done deliberately, unless its some form of punishment inflicted upon someone who had hurt one earlier, e.g. stealing something. These characteristics of course aren't all exclusive only for psychos; most of us tend to show at least a few signs like this at times though maybe not all of those. For example I've once said \u201cLet me cut open his head!\u201d in front of someone I hated. That would sound normal behavior to me, yet to others that may seem weird or rude since they were used to dealing politely without resorting to violent threats/words against enemies, rivals etc.; same way an innocuous remark like \"He doesn't love you anymore\" sounds meanwhile for others, but it means nothing serious or abusive here - no doubt that the former type will be labelled psychotic.",

I thought ok cool I\u2019m gonna call cops right away ... but ended up going home to discuss everything because it sounded pretty fake & strange-I knew him better enough to say sure he could act crazy at times due to his personality ,but usually acted fine... Then once home -called my boyfriend / momma / friends- & got an agreement to wait til next morning to talk with co workers/him together- since they hadn\u2019t left yet for evening..

The final rating will then be displayed on their profile pages. 3) To further encourage good quality answers, we introduce the \\textit{reward} mechanism which provides some extra benefit if there has been sufficient number of high-quality answers from one person. This reward can take different forms depending upon our choice at this stage but could possibly be monetary based or other types of rewards such as points etc. For example, suppose a student needs assistance with his/her assignment and posts a related question to the site. After receiving sufficient amount of satisfactory answers within a specified time limit, he/she would be provided additional compensation from the system. We believe that this method could greatly improve both the quantity and the quality of work done by the participants involved since they will get additional pay when providing more detailed and precise answers. Since these sites offer a wide range of knowledge and services, there exists a large degree of heterogeneity among them and thus various factors may affect individuals' willingness to participate effectively.\nFor instance, some people might prefer making money rather than giving advice while others seek enjoyment out of helping people whereas yet another group simply wants recognition. Moreover, even those who wish to earn money often do so only part-time because it takes up too much time.

When people understand how much potential exists within themselves, they get more engaged with work and become willing to take risks for achieving goals because of higher self-efficacy. Positive Psychology focuses more on individual characteristics which can also lead to better relationships between different members of society since this approach involves encouraging individuals to think about others from whom they could learn new ways to manage emotions such as gratitude toward other teammates. Research shows that people perform best when working together cooperatively rather than competitively; however, competition still plays an important role in shaping behaviors positively. Accordingly, focusing too much attention on one\u2019s own accomplishment may cause negative consequences due to lack of appreciation for another person\u2019s effort even if he/she was equally involved in creating good results. This is where the concept of gratitude comes into play which can serve as a great way to create mutual understanding among people.\n    \\end{itemize}\n Assistant: Why is social support considered beneficial?

            "In my opinion, when asked by one client how positivity could work for them? I would have considered a number of ways on how they may get motivated such as; reading books based around positivism, visiting other locations of which hold positive people ect. With all this being said though perhaps we need also ask what effect would that actually do. For example going into town and bumping shoulders with negative individuals might only give more reason to feel depressed rather than relieved from their current situation. Therefore I personally think there needs to much thought into the subject matter, before providing any advice upon how it will benefit someone else. Perhaps an online course could assist others better than personal consultations regarding positiveness (which after all costs money).

            "3267915020 (Jeff): Hi Assistant! This looks like an interesting question, so I am happy to respond :) Thank you for giving this a go, by sharing what we know about human wellbeing through PP interventions, let\u2019s work towards creating better people today who will then become healthier citizens tomorrow - yay!!! As you probably already have seen, there is evidence-based supportive data to back up some really important areas when it comes to looking after ourselves including mindsets/thought processes which directly relate to how we think; feelings related to emotional wellbeing; our social interactions with others & lastly but most definitely NOT least...physiological needs e.g nutrition /exercise/ sleep etc . Positive Psychologists are working on lots more topics within each of these key themes and it is amazing progress being made!! One of my favourite areas from PP is CBT where we can look at different types of negative thought patterns (which tend to arise from certain stressors) and then change them into thoughts based upon logic and reasoning (a much easier option!) We can also do similar things when dealing with emotional experiences \u2013 i.e., focusing less on emotion words and their associations to trigger upsetting feelings (negative emotional arousal) whilst reappraising such experience to understand why they might be occurring. These approaches enable us to move forward quickly in times of crisis or hardship to reduce further anxiety or distress felt in difficult life circumstances\u2026\nAside from just improving oneself positively in terms of one own self development , if you use a number of other PP tools then these same methods may assist you too with building good relationships and making sure that both yourself and those around you stay fit, fed, hydrated AND happy too :) Some useful ideas include \u2018SMART Go",
            "\\em{This method was designed by Seligman}... I agree with him. However this research shows negative results....I would argue there is still hope! We just need more data! There is always an explanation for every event.. we only have to look at other cases like that where someone was found alive after a month trapped under ice (like some recent story about the Canadian Arctic) So, what happened here? Was she too young to die?? This study could easily been conducted incorrectly if there were several confounding factors. Also these participants were not really isolated but were able to contact others. So their stress level wasn't as high..... The findings are consistent enough however. They showed the opposite result on women compared to men who lived longer lives despite depression so perhaps that proves that our bodies can cope with chronic disease when people have higher life satisfaction/lower rates of depression than expected!! That said I do believe depression causes heart attacks but i also think the cause of depresssion needs exploration before drawing conclusions such as that! For example I believe exercise and sleep quality contribute strongly and even mild depresdness affects immune system etc! And the whole genetics vs environment argument - they aren't mutual exclusives - genes play role BUT how you respond depends greatly upon the environments which are shaped through lifestyle choices-so there must surely be scope for improving mental health in most peoples circumstances? So there IS a place for preventative approaches. Just maybe less focus on risk factors because although it makes money and is necessary work , its actually pretty meaningless in helping those struggling today!! Maybe it is useful in making people feel guilty about getting sick and trying hard not to get sick though?? Increasing knowledge might encourage self management practices earlier on ie exercising to keep weight down eating better and increasing activity levels . People tend to put things off till tom"

            "The field of Positive Psychology was established by Martin Seligman in \\textit{Flourishing}. It uses research on happiness from cognition and behavioral science, social psychology and evolutionary biology (Hayes et al., 2017). According to the website for University College London\\footnote{\\url{https://www.ucl.ac.uk/psychotherapy-research}}, ``positive emotions like hope and joy increase wellbeing through making us feel good about ourselves'' but negative feelings such as fear or anxiety do the opposite. Negative emotional states lead to disordered eating patterns, addictive behaviors, selfishness and impulsivity. On the other hand, when people have strong positive relationships with others they become more prosocial towards strangers; helping them without expecting anything back in return (\\citeyear[p.~5]{PsyDocs}).\nThis is what happens according to positive psychologists because human beings have an innate desire to flourish. People who are able to cultivate this feeling experience less stress than those who live life worrying about money, their job, family issues etc... They also find themselves more likely to volunteering and participates in charitable activities which contribute positively to society (\\citeauthor{Wong_2014}, 2016). Therefore, practicing gratitude helps create stronger connections between individuals thus contributing to community development (\\citeauthor{Matthews_et_al._2013}; \\citeauthor{Emmons_McCullough_2003}). Aside from improving interpersonal relations, studies show how practices like mindfulness meditation promote empathetic thinking (\\citeauthor{Sanders_Langer_Chang}) among adolescents living in poverty (\\citeauthor{Santos_Killoren",
            "Positive Psychology (PP) is an area of study within clinical psychology which focuses on the optimal functioning of people. PP seeks to enhance well-being by using interventions based upon scientific research to increase personal strengths and resilience, and improve social relationships. PP is founded on empirically tested principles for how human behavior works and uses this knowledge to guide effective therapeutic approaches with clients \\cite{martela2016positiv}. There are five main aspects of PP including individual difference variables such as personality traits; subjective experience factors like happiness, satisfaction, optimism etc.; cognition, i.e., thoughts, perceptions, self talk; emotional states like love, compassion, forgiveness; behavioural actions e.g., gratitude journaling; and community and culture elements like support systems and institutions\\cite{mccullough2009promoting}\\cite{watkins2014brief}.\n\nThe basic idea behind PP was introduced in the book 'Positive psychology', written by Martin Seligman and Chris Peterson back in 1998 where they suggested four meta goals of PP - To identify the sources of good feeling/happiness and use these findings to create programs to increase happiness in all individuals, both those who currently have low levels of happiness and also to prevent unhappy people from becoming depressed again once they get better, to learn about the processes underlying the achievement of success at work, school and other settings through building up specific skills rather than simply trying to reduce weaknesses, to teach people ways of coping effectively when life goes wrong and lastly, to explore new possibilities in science and society and encourage further innovation into finding solutions to existing problems and developing novel methods for helping people lead meaningful lives.\nThese four ideas still form"

            "1) I think there are three main reasons for using positive psychology. The first one is because it makes people feel good about themselves and their life. Another advantage is that this theory helps them to find solutions when they have problems with their lives, such as stress. Finally, positive psychology gives us hope. It allows us to see our strengths, weaknesses and what we need to change to improve ourselves.\n2) Positive Psychology has been applied successfully to many areas including education, business, health care and social welfare. For example, it was used by teachers at an English school who wanted students to learn better. They asked children questions like \"Who do you admire?\" which made them talk positively about other people rather than criticizing each other. This method worked very well and helped children to work together more effectively.\n3) One of the most important things in my opinion about positive psychology is that it encourages people to focus on their abilities, qualities (such as kindness), talents etc. People tend to ignore these things too often so it would be great if they focused more on them. In addition, positive psychology could give us new ideas regarding how to live happily and fulfilled life.",
            "The main advantage of Positive Psychology lies in helping people to improve their lives by increasing personal strengths such as optimism, self-confidence, resilience, empathy, social skills, and so forth \\cite{pospsych}. It also helps individuals cope with negative emotions and thoughts (like stress) more effectively without resorting to addictive substances or behaviors\\footnote{\\textcolor[rgb]{1,0,.5}{https://www.apa.org/helpcenter/positiv-psychotherapy}}. In this way, it prevents depression which could lead to suicide attempts and other health problems like heart disease. Moreover, positive psychological practices have been shown successful in enabling people achieve goals related to education, career development, relationship building and so on\\footnote{\\textcolor[rgb]{1,0,.5}{\\url{ https://www.apa.org/helpcenter}}}. However, there has been some research showing that positive thinking may actually backfire when applied incorrectly due to its potential for causing narcissistic tendencies and overestimating abilities leading to failure.\\par Another major benefit of positivity is that it makes us feel good about ourselves and our life situation thereby improving mood and overall wellbeing. This leads to increased levels of happiness and satisfaction with oneself and one\u2019s surroundings thus making life better. A study showed how practicing positive activities led participants into experiencing less anxiety and worry compared to those who did nothing at all\\footnotemark [2] . Also, positive interventions were found more efficient in treating patients suffering from depressions than traditional cognitive therapies\\footnote{\\textcolor[rgb]{1,0,.5}{\\url{ http://psycnet.apa.org/?&fa=main.doiLanding&doi=10.4236\\\\97815"

            "1) I am going to use this technique with my patients who have depression because they will feel better about themselves after using this method. They may also become more optimistic which could lead them to do things like exercise regularly and eat healthy foods. This would improve their physical well-being. It might even reduce suicidal thoughts if they start feeling good about themselves again.\n2) I think this approach works best for people who already have some self esteem but need an extra boost. People who suffer from low self esteem probably won\u2019t benefit much from this type of therapy unless they first learn how to build up their confidence levels beforehand.\n3) The main advantage of this approach is that it doesn\u2019t involve talking about negative experiences so there isn\u2019t really anything bad associated with it. However, it has been criticised by some experts on mental illnesses such as Dr. David Burns (a clinician specialising in cognitive behavioural therapies). He believes that focusing too heavily on positivity can actually cause problems rather than solve them. For example, he says that when someone suffers from anxiety disorders, telling them to \u201cthink happy\u201d only makes matters worse.\n4) There aren\u2019t really any risks involved here apart from the possibility of making yourself anxious due to over thinking everything. But then again, most forms of CBT require you to focus on certain aspects of life anyway so this shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise.\n5) I believe that this form of treatment is very effective at helping people overcome various types of emotional issues including stress, anger management, addiction etc. In addition, it helps people deal with traumatic events without having to relive those memories every time they try to sleep.\n6) I think this approach is suitable for all ages although children under the age of ten wouldn\u2019t understand what it means to be"

            "1) The first element is authenticity, which means that consumers need to trust brands; they need to feel like they\u2019re speaking with friends when interacting online through social media platforms. Consumers also have high expectations for brands, and if companies fail to meet these standards on one occasion, customers will lose confidence and stop engaging altogether. For instance, if a consumer has previously had an issue with ordering from company XYZ, but then finds out about their new promotion on Facebook and decides to order from them again despite this negative experience, there needs to be some form of assurance given by the company that what happened last time won\u2019t happen again (either a guarantee of better service, or even just an apology). These kinds of measures demonstrate to the customer that the company is willing to work hard to fix past problems rather than sweeping issues under the rug \u2013 which often leads to long-lasting relationships between companies and consumers.2) Secondly, personalisation is another crucial factor of effective brand communication. Companies can easily send generic messages such as \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to all followers within seconds using automated software, however, it takes more effort to create customised communications based around individual users. Customisable messaging helps encourage greater interaction amongst audiences since individuals no longer receive emails that seem irrelevant and generic towards themselves. It also demonstrates that a brand values its audience members individually, making customers feel special, cared about and important enough to target personally - thus building stronger connections and leading to higher levels of retention overtime3) A final aspect is creativity, whereby marketers look at innovative ways to increase visibility. Social media has provided numerous opportunities for companies to do so due to the ability to post live videos, host contests, organise promotions etc., whilst simultaneously allowing other people to get involved via comments, shares & reactions"

Loyalty cannot be built overnight without building trust through genuine interactions for sustained periods of time. Building a successful company takes many years from conceptualization all the way through to becoming an established global presence. For most companies, including CitiBike by Uber; who operate bikes in almost every large metropolitan area worldwide today (not just New York City), took several years before they achieved their success status across different vertical markets. Therefore, during this growth period which typically requires huge amounts of capital for long-term investments, there must be regular proof of concepts which need constant testing until everything works properly - from productivity levels to financial impacts such as returns and benefits. After consistent results have been proven consistently under various conditions, only then can management take steps towards scaling the operations further upwards as well as downward based upon demand and feedback received globally. Without proper tracking tools in place throughout this process, management will struggle to establish whether its efforts are really working at scale because ultimately, people like simple numbers, so start using analytics early along these lines! As well as monitoring operational performance metrics like return rates etc., also track overall trends about where you are operating in terms of local events occurring at that moment and then adapt certain market strategies accordingly.\nEnsuring transparency from day one helps prevent the worst problems later on if things go wrong due to some human error somewhere along the line and affecting multiple parties involved. In my viewpoints, these core elements serve as guides for anyone who wants to get ahead whilst ensuring fairness to others everywhere - no matter what stage each party might find themselves currently at right now.\nThese three points mentioned above work very well when dealing with both internal teams internally - i."

People will buy into a story first than a feature if both happen together but most brands forget about the second part and concentrate only on features of products & services, which may sound interesting initially at best (at worst they are too good to be true!) However once the consumer knows the complete facts and figures regarding them then the buying process stops completely!

There are numerous ways through which we see companies utilising this tactic nowadays \u2013 From CSR campaigns, advertisements to blog posts and much more.

By providing customers with amazingly useful services after they purchase from you - which many times can be more valuable then what was purchased originally, and can go beyond just a simple warranty period, etc.. This makes a lasting impression on your consumers minds; so much so that some even write articles like this one! 3) Storytellers create compassionate brands that win over hearts by engaging in dialogue and connecting at deeper levels, making relationships with individuals important again. These are three key components of building customer loyalty through storytelling, and if done properly will generate results.   4) Don\u2019t forget that every person you encounter may represent hundreds of thousands of potential new clients\u2026 so treat everyone with dignity & kindness \u2013 regardless of age, race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ability, etc...

The easiest way would be to use one map that covers the entire area where you wish for the textures to appear on the weapon, then use another map which will just show up in specific locations within the first image - like, if you wanted it to look like there were two separate pieces, you could have a large square-based object atop a smaller rectangular piece; the larger object can contain the main body of your weapon but also the trigger and handle grips (which would need to have a different colour). Then, you create another material layer which contains just one small square-shaped texture covering the trigger location, and a second texture which covers the top portion of the handle (or whatever else). This allows us to see through these portions, since they won't have any texture applied to them, yet we still see what we expect because our eyes are tricked into thinking we're looking straight down at the bottom surface of each object rather than right next to it due to perspective; 3) Create a new Material Component called \"Collision\", add a Collision Mesh to it (this is basically the same thing as setting up a mesh collision component except now we have more freedom about exactly where the colliders are positioned); select the mesh collider from Step 1 above, attach the newly created Collidion Components (from Step 6 below) onto every Game Object containing the weapon meshs (so all weapons, including both sides of the barrels, the magazine, etc.), and assign the proper materials (the ones made in Steps 4 & 5 above, obviously!",

If creating landscapes (or whatever else), just choose an element you enjoy doing most - e.g., animals, buildings, people, flowers etc. Choose colours which appeal to you and express emotional values through them.\nFor example, red often represents anger but in other cultures it symbolises passion & energy so they might opt for yellow or orange shades depending on their message.

You may consider drawing either landscapes if they're your preferred genre since you said 'I am interested in drawing scenery'. This type allows more space and room to express yourself visually compared to portraits which often take up much smaller amounts of screen space, especially on phones/small devices, although you could go wild by trying to capture someone elses expression perfectly and putting them into a unique scene, but remember, keep it simple so that you can achieve everything in one shot, and if necessary just zoom into different areas when you upload your piece later rather than attempting multiple scenes. It doesn't really matter where your artwork comes from as long as it feels realistic to the person who views it; it sounds as though you aren't yet fully sure whether people viewers will see through any flaws however I would still say focus mainly around things which interest you first before anything else otherwise your work won't flow well, maybe do sketchbook pages and write down notes about places/objects that appeal to you. In terms of programs i'd recommend Gimp which is free open source software that runs across many platforms and supports most major formats and functions as an alternative photo editing tool for example https://gimpproject.org/, although I've personally found Adobe Photoshop more convenient overall since I got started with using graphic design programs back at school due to how user friendly and flexible their products are and have grown accustomed to them now.

            "\\strong{It really depends on the mood you want to evoke with this artwork.} Personally, I find landscapes more inspiring than portraits but both have their advantages and disadvantages so it will ultimately depend on which one feels better for you when drawing/painting! If you need some guidance on where to start just check out [this link](https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=landscape+drawing). It contains plenty of examples of beautiful scenery.\n\nComment: This doesn't actually answer his questions though - it provides general advice about how to get started without addressing the specifics at all (and the 'helpful, respectful & honest' bit sounds like someone else has told them they need to write these words before posting an answer)",
            "The most important thing when drawing is having fun with it! If you aren\u2019t enjoying yourself then no one else will either so find things about art that you like and incorporate them into your work such as styles/composition etc.. Drawing from life helps you understand proportions which can lead on to better portraits if done well enough (you have to start somewhere!) Landscapes require more attention but also offer great inspiration for backgrounds, compositions etc\u2026 You could always do both too. It depends entirely on personal preference though, I wouldn\u2019t say that landscapes are superior over anything really, just different, unique & challenging in their own way. There isn\u2019t necessarily an \u2018application\u2019 specific for certain types of paintings other than photoshop itself - some people prefer to create everything digitally because they want absolute control over colours / shading, others choose traditional media purely because it gives off a feeling of authenticity compared to computers, it all comes down to how comfortable you feel working with each method and ultimately how good at creating realistic looking images using whatever medium(s) you choose to experiment with! As far as software goes; GIMP has become increasingly popular amongst artists recently due to its ability to produce almost identical results to Photoshop whilst still remaining free open source.\n\\end{code}"

            "1) I like the idea of using bright colours such as orange, reds, purples and yellows for this particular project because they can really stand out on an empty screen. This will also give some contrast between the subject matter which could look quite interesting if done well! 2) As far as the composition goes, I believe it depends upon how you intend to portray this piece but I personally feel that a vertical format with the main focal point at the bottom would work best. However this doesn\u2019t mean that other compositions cannot achieve the same effect - It just happens to be my personal preference. For example, a horizontal layout may suit certain styles better depending on whether you want to focus more on the background or subject matter itself. 3) In relation to the artistic style, again this is completely down to choice however I do recommend trying to keep within one genre (either realism, impressionism, expressionism etc.). This way when viewing the finished product people who appreciate different forms of art will have their own opinion based on what type of artist they prefer. The last thing you need to consider before beginning is deciding what software you wish to create your masterpiece on \u2013 this will depend entirely on the type of medium you choose. Some programs specialise solely within specific fields whilst others are generalised allowing artists to explore all genres from abstract to traditional works.\n\\end{code}",
            "I am not sure how to give an advice on this one because I do not have much experience drawing but here goes... if you want it simple then just try sticking with black & white, however, if you want more color than go for water-colors (if you like colors). As far as composition goes.. well its up to you! You can experiment by using a variety of compositions. For example, you could start off small such as 4\" x 6\", then work towards bigger sizes. However, remember to keep your lines clean so they look crisp when enlarged. As far as the subject matter itself, I personally prefer landscapes over portraits since my art tends to tell stories through them. The reason I say that you should choose either landscape OR portrait, though, rather than both is due to time. Since you mentioned you wanted to \"draw digitally,\" which means you will probably need to learn some sort of software program to create the picture. In addition, learning how to use said programs takes A LOT OF TIME. So pick ONE thing to focus on first - either portrait/landscape or software - before moving onto another aspect of creating a good piece of artwork. Good luck :)\n\\end{code}"

            "The tsugaru dialect sounds very similar to some Korean dialects because they have shared origins. They both developed from ancient languages. Many Koreans migrated north into Japan during WW2 after the surrender.\n\nAnswer by Assistant (wrong):\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item It was caused when the Japanese were forced out of Korea by Chinese invasion, so many moved to northern parts of Honshu Island which now includes Aomori Prefecture where this dialect originates. Some Korean-speaking immigrants also settled there too around that time due to political reasons at home but mostly to work on farms here. So these two groups came together with their different cultures, resulting in a mix of culture which influenced language usage over generations until it became unique to Tsugaru City and its surrounding area. This means the original people who lived in the region before all this happened did not develop this way. But then again we do not really know much about them anyway...\n\\end{itemize}",
            "1) The Tsugaru dialect has its own pronunciation rules, which makes it very different from other regions such as Tokyo area (Standard Japanese). In addition, because of the distance between the Tsugaru region and mainland Japan, people who live there have had limited opportunities to interact with each other since long ago; this has caused their speech patterns to diverge significantly from those used by others across Japan. Finally, they tend to use slang more than other areas do. So all these factors cause difficulties when understanding one another\u2019s words even though both speak standard Japanese fluently. For example, some sentences can be interpreted differently depending on where you say them \u2013 like \u201cWhat did you just eat?\u201d might mean \u201cHow much did you pay for that?\u201d if spoken in Hokkaido but would otherwise sound like someone asking about food! This causes problems in daily life communication too. However, many residents learn English at school starting from elementary school age, and they are becoming more aware of how difficult foreign visitors find it to communicate here due to regional differences, leading to better localization efforts among locals themselves. As time goes on, I believe things will become easier to comprehend, especially with new generations.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item There aren't any particular reasons. It was only until recently that the number of tourists started increasing year after year, however we were able to handle the influx quite well thanks to our warm hospitality and the growing trends toward globalization and internationalization around the world. I think that people feel more comfortable visiting us nowadays compared to before, partly thanks to improved internet accessibility overseas, which enables anyone anywhere to get accurate and detailed info regarding places/places of interest to visit easily via websites and social media channels. And also because travel agencies and hotel companies are working harder every day to improve facilities, services etc., which makes visitors feel less nervous upon arrival"

It also helps if one learns how to read kanji too. In addition, it is probably harder for natives since they might be more familiar to certain terms used in standard japanese. This could lead them to assume that there is some meaning behind those words, when actually it doesn`t carry the same meaning as normal japanese at all...\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nComment: Thankyou very much!",

But even so what I say may still apply at least partly to other people. I just can never tell exactly. 2.). In the end my feeling will also give me feedback whether I am on track. This means that I cannot guarantee that others must agree with it either! Sometimes it makes more sense than normal to ask another person who has already done this and knows how he feels about it. For example when talking about money, but especially during intimate conversations such as marriage counseling etc... As long you feel \"at home\", you have confidence within yourself and therefore feel good internally. That would mean you could consider that your partner probably agrees with you too. The only thing that matters ultimately which works out the best. What do experts advise? How much time did they need until their internal truth was confirmed externally (the outside world)? Nobody really says here explicitly. I think everyone basically has to work through this process himself/herself. Some get it earlier, some later.. It depends again where each individual stands in development personally! Therefore I cannot define this point mathematically, simply to confirm whether someone actually gets it once and for all. Only from my own experience over many years I see patterns develop very similar from people throughout life. From these conclusions alone, I guess one could theoretically come up with criteria to determine precisely who is doing well compared to whom (which will depend on ones personal viewpoint), though most certainly not globally validated, likewise no medical scientific proof can ever prove scientifically what it really happens inside somebody after a certain length of time, because there are always exceptions anyway.. There is no precise answer! At the same time however I believe every human being carries a small core self-knowledge instinctively (if we are willing / able to listen). It comes"

In order for an experiment/methodology to work correctly one must assume all factors affecting it will remain constant throughout testing, however due to various circumstances outside of our control, these variables did change over time resulting in failure to replicate. So we need more data from multiple sources using different methods and conditions in order to validate this idea furthermore. \\strong{My guess} would be that some sort of interference happened between myself and others attempting to test the same method at the same time causing our outcomes to differ slightly, since I believe no two people experience the world exactly alike even with similar backgrounds. Therefore my hypothesis is likely correct but needs confirmation via independent trials with better controls and improved methods to increase reliability and repeatability of experiments conducted across groups of participants.

(Explaining how the storming of Bastille started) \\n Assitant: In July 1789, a mob of Parisians attacked a prison called Bastille that held several political prisoners. This sparked a violent revolt throughout most of France that forced monarchs out of power and led to the execution of King Louis XVI. \\n\\n User: How can we prevent such conflicts from happening again today? \\n Assistant: To reduce conflict I suggest the following: \\n\u2022\tWe must stop wars! \\n\u2022\tAll nations need to work together to protect our planet. We have no other home!\\n \u2022\tGovernments around the world need to invest into education"

            "The French revolution was caused by a number of reasons some were internal such ats; the monarchy, the noblesse de rois( nobility from King), the church,and external factors like other countries invading France for land so they could take money away and build an army to get more land. The financial crisis had alot to do with it because they needed money since a lot people died so the government did taxation. When the Third estate got involved their power started growing. They wanted freedom so if they didn\u2019t join them then they would go to war against eachother. After Marie Antoinette gave out cakes made of \u201cRose\u201d she went back up her castle but the angry crowd kept getting closer until the guards threw piss filled wine bottles at them. People were dying left right and center during the revolution they even had to throw body parts onto pyres cause no one knows where all the bodies are buried\u2026 This shows how much pain there really was through this whole event\u2026  I think this is important because It really showed everyone what things they need to change before its too late! So now we have good leaders who aren\u2019t corrupted who lead us toward prosperity and happiness . We learned our lesson !!!\n\\end{code}",
            "The primary cause was high taxes set by absolute monarchy, such as taxation without representation, corrupt government officials who were taking bribes which caused problems with supply (the government had stopped paying suppliers for goods). Furthermore, bad harvests also increased prices at grocery stores. This led to higher demand but since there weren\u2019t enough resources due to the previous reasons it became less available, so they rioted. It could have been prevented through other governments where people had more say when decisions about their country are made; democracy might be one example, however this would take time to implement, hence I believe a change like this wouldn't have helped much after many years already passed before this would have come into place and most likely would be considered too late if ever implemented later down the line. In conclusion, i would say the main causes were corruption between wealthier classes of society, poor economy/ lack of money , high taxes setting unfairly, no representation within the ruling elite(absolute power), bad harvest year for many parts across Europe causing inflated food cost . So yes, i feel like these did play an important part overthrowing Louis XVI &amp; Marie Antoinette. One consequence that came out because of this rebellion was that King Louis XVI lost his head- that definitely has negative connotations attached! This is seen both historically from the point of view perspective for France and still today considering its effects can still be felt amongst some. Another thing occurred following the revolution itself during \"The Reign Of Terror\", and although many innocents suffered terrifying loss- including having family members sentenced & executed - those guilty of wrong doing against the population may finally receive punishment.... even though it wasn't justified, it shows how some aspects of their methods worked towards reaching their ultimate goal. Many lives were taken away unnecessarily, despite that sometimes people"

            "It was an era of revolutions; one country after another went through major upheavals from this period starting with the American Revolution then moving towards the Haitian revoltuion. Then France started it\u2019s own revoltion where the french citizens demanded for equality amongst each other (not only just nobles vs commoners) , the poorest classes had more power than before since they could finally voice out their opinion now but some things did happen which resulted them getting slaughtered such as The Great Fear were around two hundred thousand people lost their lives during the year between April & October. There have been several causes that lead up to this such as The American Revoution happened at roughly the same time whereby many intellectuals saw what happened over there so maybe the french felt like \u201cwe want that too!\u201d so thus causing riots to begin within France . And because King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette did nothing about the problem by not taking into account of his/her citizins request so it eventually caused even worse situation and later when it escalated it ended badly with everyone being dead and gone! Also i believe there must be something wrong financially as well hence why i stated previously. As far as third estate goes\u2026I do recall that there has been something similar to third class before where those who weren\u2019t rich enough also had no right to speak yet here we go again the government making the poor even worse off without rights compared to how life used to be !!! This really sucks..so overall all these events contributed together made it difficult for anyone else living inside France during this Era !! I hope this helps ..Good Luck!!! ^_^\""

            "10. The French revolution began because people wanted more democracy but it did NOT happen overnight. It took many years from the start of Louis XV until Napoleon came into power for France to become a republic with a constitution. There was a huge gap between rich and poor during this time period which lead up to the revolution. People were starving and needed jobs so they could survive. They had no money to buy food or clothes etc.. Many farms were going bankrupt due to lack of crops. This caused a lot of famers to loose their land when they couldn\u2019t afford taxes and rent anymore. Also, there was a huge gap among different classes of society at this point. The middle class was rising and getting stronger by becoming wealthier than before and having better education. However, the lower class still wasn\u2019t able to get much higher paying jobs like what the upper class has access too. The lower class didn\u2019t really have an income except maybe some odd job here and then and weren\u2019t given equal rights either. For example they would be arrested if caught stealing bread even though it might keep them alive! These things all led up to the beginning of the French revolution.\n\n\\section{Conclusions}"

            "I believe it depends on what type of player you want to be. A farmer will need to grow crops such as wheat, potatoes, carrots, turnips, and melons. Wheat takes roughly three days to grow if planted by hand but can also be grown with a plow which requires one day per crop planted. Potato seeds take about two minutes to sprout from water and require four hours for each harvest once they have matured into fully-grown plants. Carrot, Turnip, Melon seeds all produce a similar time span between growing and harvesting and these vegetables taste great when cooked with coal.\n\nThe other way would be to collect animals, like chickens and sheep (or goats) and feed them so that eventually their egg output increases or give milk at an increased rate.

            "The following steps can be taken by anyone to achieve farming: \\strong{First}, choose what kind of animal one wants to start with, whether it is a chicken (egg) for laying eggs daily at around dawn until sunset. One can get 20-40+ per day, which may increase over time due to higher health status and more fertile chickens; this can provide many raw egg materials. Also one might consider having an incubator such as an Endermen Egg Incubation Box which provides the most eggs, or using another type of furnace. Increasing their health via iron and gold can boost them into giving out eggs quicker too! However if there is no Iron nearby, one will need to craft the material before they could even build a minecart. Alternatively if you do have some Gold ore but nowhere near an active coal mine then it would also require mineral extraction via cobblestone dust/iron nuggets/diamond tools to gain those ingredients from other resources, like Coal or Quartzite, both requiring either Iron Dust, Iron Nugget or Diamonds respectively depending on where it spawns within your world, otherwise just place these blocks inside your base area next to your bedrock or stone brickwork for storage purposes only! Or you can buy the recipe for Iron Golems for about $5,639 each through Creative mode and put up 12 Iron Ingots underground and collect when finished building, which can give lots of items after killing and placing it somewhere close enough so its mobility can carry stuff without taking away the ability to dig and smelt, and later take them off the mob to sell once fully grown for more profit! Or if someone prefers Crafting Mode and doesn't want to use Creative, it is easier yet slower because all three options still involve some work in gathering",
            "I will do this! This one takes longer than other sources because it has lower harvesting rates, but they grow much faster overall, which means that eventually (around ~5-10 days) all the plants are ripe for pickin'. Just collect them once they are matured, put some baskets around and fill them with what ever food items can fit inside of 'em... It would be great if we had chests here though; maybe then I could use more advanced tools such as swords etc... The most common method people used when mining resources was the same thing minecraft players usually did before crafting recipes, like building stairs/staircases, or bridges between islands by stacking rocks into piles using torches to burn off blocks, creating huge cathedrals from small squares and cubes... That was very effective, efficient way too since back in those olden times people were so stupid... Soon enough people found out about farming and decided it would work even better at generating quick results rather than taking long time and energy consuming steps.... Soon enough there weren\u2019t just crops planted everywhere anymore; houses appeared next, made entirely from wooden logs.. But then the real problems began appearing after many centuries have passed away; there were wars among countries due to overpopulation; lack of land became problematic also due to continuous increase of population... There was an attempt of creating space traveling vessels powered solely through electricity... Many failed, and ended up causing global disasters. A lot of natural life died because of the machines built on their behalf; Earth\u2019s ozone layer depleted dramatically. We tried saving ourselves using different technologies such as fusion generators or cold nuclear reactions\u2026 We got rid of pollution but then came diseases...

As barns grew larger over time, with added levels stacked against each other, they became increasingly fire-prone due to their greater surface area combined with higher stock densities. By around 1700, architects started enclosing the structures into two or more compartments of different height so that fires did not spread from storey to storey. Some features were introduced only when these compartmentalized designs had become popular. At first, hay loft doors were horizontal but later developed to be vertical so carts could roll under them. Often, the lofty interior could contain equipment such as balk-hoists (used to lift bundles of fodder onto carts) which required headroom comparable to that found inside a modern grain elevator today. A common feature of barns since their early days has been raised platforms on either side of entrances called passages where draft horses were tethered during bad weather so it would not rain on them while standing outside during a thunderstorm.:\u200a16\u200a\n\\end{blockquote}",

A Barn has a loft space above ground for grain storage or hay stacking on the upper level, whereas some structures were open below the loft, having been converted from old barns which did have roof access doors, or which never had one installed due to structurability reasons at first place - depending on whether the owner preferred stall type enclosures underneath, which were built against the side walls so there would no longer need such large opening into their premises since horses, oxen etc... Would still fit within without disturbance if needed to leave through said doorways.. Barns vary widely according to construction material & function/type and region of country where they occur.... Some common terms include cattle shed , dairy cow house , milking parlor, stable /stableyard /horse-stalls or simply stable. Barn yards may be surrounded by stone walling (pillars) made of sandstone bricks etc..., and/or cement brick pillar structures surrounding these barn houses for better security and privacy protection. These structures typically included wood frame structures which allowed greater freedom for builders and home owners who might desire additional buildings in areas that require them... These homes are very often seen as a necessity today in our world where more land needs to be cleared before people can begin constructive use towards improving the lives of humans in society around us... We hope to find good jobs near home too.. and not all farmers can afford huge property prices to get outright real estate purchases going anymore unless family money exists for generations... But",
            "A barn was originally defined by a roofed building where farmers stored grain (wheat). This comes from Middle English and derives ultimately from Old Norse *berndr (\"shelter\"), with Germanic counterparts found across Northern Europe including Swedish berg (\"rocky place\", eponymous for Sweden) and Norwegian bergja-form (\"hay shed\"). It first appears c.1300 AD but may be earlier based on Scandanavian origins; its ultimate root goes back into Proto-Germanic (*bergon\u0105-) meaning \u201cprotection\u201d, related also to other Germanic words like English \u201cbury\u201d (as opposed to burying things), burial ground etc.. In some contexts it came to mean any shelter/dwelling place - e.g. ship, tent \u2013 before settling on one particular kind around late middle ages and becoming specific once more at end of medieval times when specialised barns began appearing (i.e., large ones specifically used only for storage); see below under history for further detail about development. In British dialect, particularly Cockney London accents, an older usage still persists for all buildings with flat rooves regardless if they contain animals, humans, cars etc.; however most non-Londons consider this slangishly old fashioned and incorrect, hence less likely to encounter it than standardised variant above which now prevails over most English speaking areas save possibly American regions with significant European heritage. For similar reasons the plural form of barn varies too according to whether one thinks the main definition of such shelters remains wheats storage today versus dwellings historically (with a corresponding effect upon pronunciation of said singular and thus consequently its derivatives). However even those who hold this view agree on a singular spelling variant as against common modern useage which retains a separate inflection for each of these definitions, thereby"

Therefore, having more than one stable meant there was a need for an easier naming system which led them to create the word \"\\em{baerlin}\".\n4) Finally, when the British conquered America, they brought over their words but also introduced a new spelling variation - \"barn\"; hence, its current use in American society.",

But at low end they have very little effect because it depends on how much their take home pay falls after taking out all deductions (taxes) from their income, where in most cases taxes don\u2019t apply anymore. The government has tried giving small business exemptions but these are temporary due to expiring every year so this doesn't do anything about incentivizing workers, also its usually just enough money not to push them over the threshold into losing net zero benefits per week. So there might be less incentives for low skilled labour jobs etc.. It really depends though since many countries have flat rate tax system without personal allowances. In such case even if tax bracket was set quite close to minimum wage job then employers would still want employees as long as wages were sufficient below cost of living/minimum wage plus enough savings from working towards buying house to go with it. As time went along however people got better educated through universities so demand increased which lead to price hikes, leaving people unable to save enough money and forcing prices upwards once again leading everyone back down to same place. Thus I don't think raising tax brackets for higher income people will cause them any issues at hand either because some would simply choose extra days offs like me (as well as saving for holidays), others would reconsider choosing one job versus another and lastly you get those who simply opt-out when things become inconvenient despite making significantly large amounts already.

I just wanted confirmation on my own beliefs\n\nAnswer: In theory, yes, but only marginally; see e.g., https://econjwatch.org/file/6709/marginal-tax-rates_effects-on-labor-supply/.  This study looks at \"income tax rates\", i.e. across all sources of income.   As a consequence, it is probably also affected by things like how many exemptions you may receive based upon filing status (i.e., number of dependents).    However, when we consider specific situations, where a worker receives most income from one source -- such as employment vs. capital gains investments - then these results tend to disappear altogether, and you start seeing behavior consistent with no impact, especially during recessions when wages decrease, thereby decreasing after tax labor costs and making work appear cheaper compared to alternatives (which may even be available under the current laws), resulting in greater motivations towards additional work, including potentially reducing hours worked.",
            "I am very good at researching, writing about politics & current affairs; hence can easily give this information! :) Yes - It definitely reduces motivation/incentives for working. As more money has been taken from individuals, there is less incentivising factors towards employment, resulting in reduced income due to loss of motivating factors like rewarded hardwork, job security etc., and ultimately fewer people would want to get employed in these conditions, reducing labour market size further, creating another cycle which could result in widespread recession across sectors such as healthcare (nurses) where salaries aren\u2019t too high.  https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/are-higher-taxes-on-the-rich-good-for-society This website clearly states \"If tax revenues rise then public spending must also go up \u2013 meaning other government services have to be cut\".  Hence by cutting on the lower classes's disposable incomes it may affect their living standards drastically causing social instability which is likely going to cost the nation more than gaining tax revenue initially gained. There will also be no need to provide essential jobs within our economy, such as teachers or doctors as many would not apply due to lack of incentival benefits compared with the risk factor of low pay or zero hour contracts which exist nowadays, resulting in large gaps within industries which were previously full, and so we may even face problems like overpopulation due to decreasing population size overall which causes environmental damage such as air pollution increasing if cars cannot keep pace, as well as housing crisis if numbers become scarce due to overcrowding and increase of demand outstripping supply, both issues being very damaging environmentally especially in an already struggling world ecosystem which has faced mass extinction before during prehistoric times"

Also another reason can also be seen as a disadvantage to high marginal tax rate such as lowering ones desire to invest due to lack of financial security wherein people who have little to lose do not bother to invest into future endeavors such as building companies and other projects since their return on capital will not justify what they put into the company which could possibly lead to an economic slowdown which can hurt society as a whole; thus reducing our overall GDP and living standards as well. 2) In my opinion yes since raising the income limit of how much you earn before getting hit with higher marginal taxes would result in individuals working smarter rather than just working longer hours to compensate for low wages resulting in a decrease in employment and subsequently reducing production leading to fewer jobs available in turn. Another example would be a CEO whose job description requires him/her to attend many meetings during his tenure with clients etc.; however, once he gets older his physical condition begins to deteriorate which reduces his productivity causing his company to start losing money since they rely heavily upon him attending all these functions in order to bring business into the company thereby creating an unfair advantage over those without access to top tier health care. 3) In general terms i think this would only happen in countries where workers were given basic benefits like food clothing housing and shelter since if a person had everything covered already then he/she has nothing else to worry about except keeping himself/herself happy henceforth resulting",

This happens when the sugar is transformed into alcohol via fermention with the presence of yeast cells, which produce CO2 from glucose + water => gluconic acid + Hydrogen gas(H2) + CO2;\nThe reaction can be expressed as follows: $$\\ce{C6H12O6_{(aq)} + 4 C3H8O7_{{(aq)}} ->[\\Delta]  5 CH3COOH_{(l)} + 6 CO_2_{(g)}+ 2 H_(aq)+ O_2_{(l)}.}$$\nSo basically, this means that there is an exchange between oxygen molecule(which we breathe out), hydrogen gas(H2) and carbon dioxide(CO2); The latter two gases will eventually form a mixture called carbonated liquid.\nIn other words, if the amount of sugar consumed exceeds the quantity produced, then there would be excessive production of CO2 gas.

It also lets others who listen know exactly what they can expect from hearing such music pieces, since different speeds create entirely different atmospheric sounds depending on how long it lasts, so that means there\u2019ll be different feelings attached too, so it becomes easier for someone listening without reading music to feel those emotions within them through knowing how fast it will sound, thus allowing everyone to get involved with enjoying music together if it were performed live in concert somewhere sometime somehow..  \nTheories about these ideas vary over the centuries and are based on how our brain functions with regard to how we interpret notes heard. They do say we learn better with pictures and symbols though so learning theories involve both methods used. Including drawings to describe notes in music is part of making it clearer and helping people remember new material quicker because of seeing a visual aid that reminds us what happened previously in class and/or helps recall specific events regarding whatever was discussed in detail.    This topic isn\u2019t taught everywhere, but only specialised institutions that cater especially for teaching people who would enjoy doing so themselves and earning a living performing, singing or creating new work later. Many teachers of Music have degrees and mastery knowledge related to how they can perform all types of styles in their field and are very profound individuals whom often need lots of study just before going into classes",

For example, some people might ask which chord goes best with C Major, you could give them an idea of which chords work well together like F#m7b5 #11 or Gmaj7 b9sus4 #9, however, these can seem quite complicated and confusing especially at first when learning.

Also it might work better with some kind of friction on one side because once its spinning forward the force will go upwards rather than outward causing an arc path where you want straight. The frictions could either come from air resistance (like a paper plane) but I\u2019m not sure how effective this method is at stopping things without them just hitting a wall like they were before they hit the ground. Maybe use sandpaper on the inside part facing down? That way maybe we can get both a little more power for acceleration AND braking? But yeah i agree it definitely has to be moving superfast though cause thats what causes it to turn right! And finally using gravity against itself by letting it fall through water might slow it enough for it to actually turn right even if only slightly\n\nComment: Welcome to MathSE.

They are required because of this, so that they can reach greater speeds; like the one described below in point number two which will showcase just how great speeds we require for reaching deep into Space, where our Universe started off from..! As per current calculations & calculations done by Albert Einstein way back around ~ century ago, it would take an infinite time span before the Universe gets explored completely without coming to a halt ever again in its journey ahead . Which means even if all matter & forces within the universe could be calculated exactly then their product wouldn\u2019t match up with what astronomers believe currently exists today. So let me give u few examples; 2. A rocket at Earth\u2019s orbit has to overcome earth gravity pulling towards itself about $10^{34}$ N but since we do not wish to move objects only once, rather continously at some velocity we would have to apply torques on it (i.e. equal opposite torque from the other sides) whose magnitude is very high too - enough to surpass the strength created out of these huge atoms to accelerate them further to a super fast escape velocity. This value needs to go beyond about $9 \\times 10^6$ N m/kg which also exceeds theoretical limit proposed by James Clerk Maxwell in second law of thermodynamics for perpetual machines. So now given all this enormous energy requirement I assume the most efficient rocker could attain only about $v_0 = c / (\\sqrt{mg} g_{NUT} t)$ ($c=$ speed of light and $g\\left(= G/r^2)\\right$ being Newton\u2019s gravitational constant).

A large mass (a star) generates enough force against it's own mass when falling under gravity - so even with all these engines, the ship would still move very slowly towards another star unless some kind of energy was put into motion too! So basically the thrust has an opposite reaction. And also the bigger a vessel/engine, more powerful its reactions get because more matter will collide due to gravitational attraction, meaning less work per second. Also I heard once they were experimenting how big the fuel tanks need to be if one wanted to go really far...but again that doesn\u2019t apply for smaller craft which have different physics altogether :) But what happens after this fuel runs dry isn't yet discovered!!

I can't speak from experience but i believe they may use their main engines (the ones which give them power) more often than using smaller thruster units since they tend to require less energy input when used over long periods of time compared to smaller engines/thrusters. This allows the ship to remain in orbit around a planet without having to burn up all its fuel trying to stay stationary in one spot at all times like what we see with the USS Enterprise.

            "1) The rocket propulsion systems on these spaceships are so big because they need enough fuel capacity to travel through interstellar distances without stopping for refueling. This is especially relevant if the ship has to carry supplies for long term colonization missions such as terraforming planets. 2) Rockets use chemical energy to create motion by pushing gas molecules together (combustion), which creates thrust against whatever object the rocket is attached to, allowing it accelerate forward. A typical rocket uses a liquid oxygen/kerosen mixture to power its engines. In order for this system to work correctly, it must produce enough combusted gas to be able to push outward hard enough to escape Earth\u2019s gravitational pull. However, since gravity decreases with distance from an object like the Sun, less force would be required at greater distances than closer ones \u2013 thus requiring more fuel. 3) Rocket science requires lots of research into how much fuel will be needed per trip, based upon factors including distance traveled, speed desired and time allotted to reach destination. Since we cannot predict exactly what variables may arise during each journey, scientists usually build in a large safety margin when designing rocket fuel requirements. 4) There isn\u2019t always a lot of room onboard a starship to store extra cargo, meaning every bit needs to count. Therefore, engineers tend to overbuild rockets rather than risk having too little fuel supply for their mission, resulting in larger rockets carrying more fuel but also taking up valuable storage space on a ship.\n\\end{blockquote}"

The weights learned from training the self-attention block is then used in another part of network with different type of task which will compute different kind of cross attention but uses those pretrained parameters without fine tuning again, because we believe they generalize well over similar data and tasks.(this answer might sound complicated due to its non trivial nature , i would highly recommend watching some lecture on transformers like [these](https://youtu.be/VkZgWfUvHjQ)).

Water only during the daytime and let the plant absorb the maximum available nutrients before sunlight begins again because direct light causes faster loss of vitamins than other forms such as fluorescent bulbs due to heat produced by this artificial radiation. So keep an eye out and monitor your pots carefully using natural senses such as eyesight & smell/aroma rather than rely too much upon technical gadgets such as automatic irrigation system and electric meters because both tend to miss things especially the former one, and thus they end up causing wasteful water losses resulting from either overwatering(leaching of fertilizer components into atmosphere due to oversaturated media leading to root rot & decay) or underwatering (lack of hydration which also results into eventual wilting, witchy appearance etc.). A good trick would be placing each pot individually in different rooms in home/office area or keeping them near window openings but always ensuring sufficient protection against harsh elements such as rain/hail storms etc. And it helps greatly if one can arrange to grow various kinds of vegetable seeds simultaneously together since they have mutal symbiosis in many cases like some weed types that naturally provide better sustenance and shelter to young saplings growing next to each other along pathways & driveways or around backyard borders..

Watering plant with rainwater causes it to grow slowly compared other sources of water such as river/lake water etc..

The reason for this is that rainwater has higher concentration of mineral particles like sodium chloride (NaCl), sulphates(SO4H2O) , nitrates(NO3- )etc .

The way we usually advise our clients with regards this type of project management for complex technical solution building is :\n2a ) To choose some well established professional expertise and trustworthy software vendors who already build their solutions specifically orientated towards handling business communication solutions (like Openexchange.net). It can easily get complicated if one has very specific needs which might require custom development of specialised hardware or network systems . Therefore it seems sensible enough especially from an expense point of view to work around preconfigured and ready made enterprise level platform products (like open exchange), which could save thousands upon dollars spent within months before one gets off the ground!\n3b ) But again having said that there will need to be careful consideration given into how the service provider's licensing and setup costs compare against other alternative offers available via similar vendor platforms e.g., if say some company has used Microsoft Exchange Server then a more cost effective solution may possibly involve deploying Mobility Services as opposed to Windows Mailboxes on top , because the latter typically come at substantially larger feeds per user licence pricing ."

There are various ways to achieve such authentication. Some systems allow you to specify username and password in the message header; some other services require additional configuration steps like creating accounts first. 7) A lot depends upon whether you want your email to remain private and encrypted between you and the recipient, or if you want to openly publish everything you send to anyone who happens to ask for it - i.e. no encryption involved here. 8) As far as privacy goes, I would recommend using PGP (PGP stands for Pretty Good Privacy) which provides end-to-end security and encryption of data during transmission.

Clicking \"no\" leads back here, without allowing any further choices such as \"Neutral.\"\nHow do I give neutral feedback when someone has given me bad advice??? My understanding from reviewers is that only negative feedback counts toward their score so how could they possibly improve??\nI think there needs to be some balance between giving good/bad advice according to different values of what constitutes \"goodness.\" For instance, someone might want to get rid of all grass to avoid keeping up with maintenance, BUT that would NOT provide them with sufficient cover against invasive bugs. They MUST choose one or the other at SOME point unless they are willing to pay others to do stuff regularly, which is totally another option to consider along with everything else mentioned above. I find people's suggestions often seem to miss important details about what happens next... as though they were speaking in generalities rather than taking into account where things go beyond just growing tomatoes or having fruit trees without regard for anything else happening elsewhere on the property, etc.. Maybe this is due to lack of background knowledge about the subject(s), but even IF they had prior experience, it is still likely most people won't appreciate getting too detailed because each person's context differs greatly depending upon location, region, elevation, climate, soil conditions, terrain....\nAny thoughts about helping out",
            "A quick google search will reveal how much one can grow on such small scale with little to no effort (easiest would be fruit trees). For more specifics, use soil tests from local places like Home Depot for example. Just mix some sand / organic matter and add it slowly over time after using a rake or water hose. Spraying the ground and digging holes may also speed up the process. However once grown ,you need to care properly by feedings, watering etc ..\nAlso for fruits consider what climate conditions the tree species normally grows in, since growing exotic types might end up failing badly if temperature or water shortage gets too high!\nI think you might want to read here : https://www.wikihow.com/Plant-a-Garden-on%2C0r-%601_Acre http://growitall.blogspot.in/2013/04/low-maintenance-lawn-or-bountiful.html ?\n\nComment: thankyou so mucchh"

Workers perform various tasks like food collection, communication etc. They are social creatures and cooperate with others during hard times. They are highly organized and hence work efficiently together. However, some species are much smaller compared to others (like fire ants, etc.). The reason behind selecting such species was mainly because larger ones require bigger equipment and space wherein smaller ones need less. Also, many species die out quickly resulting in lower chances of getting new specimen everyday.

We cannot look through the whole collection as it grows because even after all this time and work still remains! But maybe with future technologies this could be achieved\u2026I hope sometime soon too.   The other method I have read about was to try to compare genetics amongst the collections to see whether differences in physical traits could reflect distinct species \u2013 however due to variation within a species it wouldn\u2019t tell us everything about a species and thus further investigation would need to be carried out, including detailed descriptions based on observation. However DNA barcoding technology may well solve most issues surrounding species identification...I hope!     Some people might think taxonomy seems easy but actually once you start thinking deeply about the problem you realize its extremely difficult; for example there aren\u2019t enough specimens in existence today let alone ones preserved throughout history and even though the field now includes molecular methods for identification like PCR amplification, restriction enzyme analysis & sequencing and other modern approaches such as biochemistry/electron microscopy studies to investigate protein structures - nothing yet exists which is completely accurate in comparison with studying the living animals themselves....\n\\end{blockquote}",
            "They collect samples from all over the world with a net which helps them to see their characteristics so then when there done looking at the bugs for long enough, they look at them under magnifying glasses where if its a different size/color combination than one another they will have already looked it up into books that have been published. There could be hundreds even thousands more bugs found before someone figures out how to stop bug spreading. It can also take time just figuring things like how fast this specific kinda spider grows by just comparing numbers from a couple days to each other and then having those compare with ones a month ago until the data matches exactly to give us an accurate timeline about everything happening now to everything we had back when they were little kids growing inside eggs but no adults yet.. I wouldnt mind working alongside entomologist someday...I am sure theres much work still to do since scientisits haven\u2019t studied half the animals in the entire world and theres a ton thats extinct now due to people cutting down trees or using poison to get rid of stuff (poison used in gardeners to kill slugs and snails). Its crazy that the number 1 way people use pesticides in their own home gardens isn\u2019t only bad for plants themselves because humans need plant life too for oxygen. So its also affecting the amount of oxygen our bodies absorb when we breath causing death and cancer to become a thing...But most of the planet earth was made with chemicals including our air anyway though!  Also its very easy for these research teams to mess up since theres such huge variation among many insect types meaning its difficult sometimes trying to identify things especially considering we aren\u2019t really familiar with how much detail entomology needs compared to biology etceteras ...There has probably been more times mistakes were made accidently that lead to loss of funds because money doesn\u2019t grow on tree stumps"

            "Insects have been around for hundreds of millions of years. There are an estimated total of more than 10 million described species worldwide, but scientists estimate there could be between one hundred quadrillion (one thousand trillion) and ten sextillion (a number with twenty zeros after it), meaning many billions more exist undiscovered. Insects may also be among the oldest animals still alive today, surviving almost every extinction event since life first appeared on earth over four billion years ago. Scientific classification divides living things into broad categories based upon common traits shared by all organisms within them. Entomology focuses exclusively on the scientific study of insects which comprise approximately 25% of known animal diversity, making up about 93 percent of all terrestrial species. They represent more than half of all biological species; i.e., \"there are at least as many different kinds of insects as there are other multicellular organisms\". Insects live everywhere except for certain places where temperatures never get above freezing point. For example, insects cannot grow underneath ice sheets. Most species eat plants or plant material from fruits, leaves, stems etc.. However, there are many groups of carnivorous insects including predaceous mites, mantids, stick insects, grasshoppers, praying mantises, dragonflies, dobsonfly larvae, true bugs such as assassin bugs and ladybugs, spiders, centipedes, millipedes, lacewings, soldier fly larvae, rove beetles, earwigs, tiger beetle larvae, ambush bug adults, parasitic wasps, crab spider eggs, thrips, chiggers, and many others. Many people find these creepy craw",
            "I believe it depends if there was a previous classification system put into place for these particular species already by another research team or scientist(s). It could be difficult depending upon how many different types/species there may potentially be because they all have their own unique features & traits that distinguish them from each other; such as coloring, shape etc.. For example one bug might look similar to others but just has small differences here n there that set it apart. Some bugs may even blend with its environment (e.g. tree bark) which makes finding specimens much harder when trying to find new ones! So overall my suggestion would be to go through past studies & try to build off those ideas until we get more accurate results regarding the exact number of existing insects & species found so far...I hope this helps!! :) Good luck with everything! \\n\\nAnswered at :13m25s"

            "Entomology can be divided into two main branches; medical and agriculture entomology. The former focuses on the study of arthropods such as flies and mosquitoes with regard to human health and diseases. Medical entomology studies how these organisms transmit pathogens from one host to another. For example it may study the transmission cycle of dengue fever which involves an infected female Aedes aegypti mosquito feeding off humans then passing the virus onto its next hosts via biting them when it becomes hungry again after a blood meal. Agricultural entomology deals primarily with crop pests like whiteflies. It also includes research related issues such as integrated pest management (IPM). IPM seeks to reduce reliance upon chemicals used for controlling pests by developing alternative strategies such as using resistant varieties of plants or introducing natural predators to keep populations down naturally rather than relying solely on chemical control methods. One challenge faced by all entomological scientists relates to funding sources. Most universities receive government grants for their scientific projects. These funds have been decreasing over time so scientist must compete more fiercely each year just to stay afloat financially. Another challenge faced by those who wish to enter this field has become increasingly difficult recently because there simply aren\u2019t enough jobs available. This means people often find themselves working multiple part-time positions at low pay just to get started out until better employment opportunities arise.\n\\end{code}\n\nThis code works great except if I try to add a newline character before \"Entomolo\" it doesn't work properly...\nHere my code :\n\n\\begin{code}\nfrom nltk import sent_tokenize, wordpunct_tokenize#, nlp #\n#import pandas as pd ##\nimport string",
            "1) The first step for scientists studying an animal is to describe it using scientific terms. Scientific names can be used to refer directly back to a specific specimen. They are usually written in Latin so all humans around the world will understand them. For example: Aphidius erythrinae. In order to identify which organisms we want to research more thoroughly, taxonomic keys were developed by Linnaeus (the father of modern taxonomy), Carl von Linn\u00e9. This system allows us easily determine if an insect belongs to one family versus another based upon their physical characteristics. For instance, there is no difference between a dragonfly larvae from the family Libellulidae compared to those of other families such as Zygoptera or Odonta. However, this method cannot be applied to all types of insects because some have different body parts than most other animals. Some examples of these unique creatures would be spiders, scorpions, centipedes, millipedes, crustaceans and arachnids. These groups require different methods to sort through the diversity present in our natural environments. To further simplify things, many times we use common names rather than scientific ones when describing an organism. It makes communicating with others much easier but also leads to confusion about how many species exist within each group. For instance, there could be several thousand members belonging to the Order Diptera (flies). But only two generas of flies are commonly known; house fly Sarcophagus and blow fly Calliphora!\n\\end{blockquote}"

Since then many new orders were described, but most of them were based upon morphological characteristics only.

There has been an increase in demand from urban populations seeking greenery which resulted in large scale developments such as parks, gardens and recreational areas. It also focuses on using natural systems (for example wetlands) to treat water resources where necessary before releasing them back into surrounding environments. The goal was always to create more pleasant living conditions by making these natural elements accessible to everyone with easy access to healthy food sources and clean air. There are three main phases involved in this process; Site Analysis, Design Development and Construction Administration. During site analysis we take note of our surroundings, identify problem areas, evaluate feasibility factors and plan the future development based off those findings. Once planning is complete it goes onto the next phase of designing which involves sketches, modeling and research done to formulate ideas for implementation. In final stage construction administration will be carried out which consists of oversight activities related to construction projects including inspections, contract management and cost control. This ensures quality assurance of project components and compliance with approved plans.\n\n### Example of assistive text generation without ground truth\n\nAssistant: Where would I go if my favorite restaurant went bankrupt?\n\nUser: My local diner!

These diseases would often be dealt with by using pesticides however these come at cost. When working with other plants and the terrain itself there will need to take into consideration factors such as slope stability meaning whether the soil profile supports this site otherwise drainage may become more likely, erosion etc... Another principle is providing habitats for biodiversity both flora and fauna in different climates which means making sure suitable conditions exist during all seasons for animals and insects whilst creating landscapes suited towards wildlife.\n5 Other Principle and Technique - Making sustainable designs so the environment is protected through energy efficiency, resource conservation and waste minimization. Providing pathways to move easily between two areas for pedestrians who wish to view specific features ect.. also important for mobility users (eg wheelchair). Avoiding invasive species of trees, shrubs and flowers as well as native floral communities where the natives provide natural resources and support a large amount of bird life throughout winter periods and even some breed their young here along side mammals who seek shelter after hibernating for months. Many plants provide medicinal purposes/herbal remedies for humans especially those suffering medical conditions therefore taking care of our greenhouse effect and the increasing rate of climate change, growing organic crops, re purposing materials rather than building new structures, using biodegradables products, recycling etc....etc ...\n\\end{",

Besides the environment we could select we are bound by certain regulations e.g. horticultural law for plant species and water quality requirements for irrigation.\n[Hide Answer](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8n7Z9NMGzqoV2xFbXh6WmpLYXVkTGpjUlRiSkt3Q1E4ZDJOdFlKaFEv)</blockquote>"

            "Landscape architectural plans generally take into account climate patterns and ecosystem health before determining appropriate layout strategies for new development projects such as residential housing subdivisions and parks and public plazas.\\n  For example, many large cities experience very high summer temperatures because there has been so much building activity throughout the last several decades, resulting in heat island effect and poor air quality issues like smog\\n \\n \\nAs well as creating urban heat islands through construction methods like using dark coloured paving materials (asphalt), planting only green lawn grasses with little or no trees or shade plants on streetside front yards creates excessive sun exposure for people passing by.\\n\\nTherefore one approach may be to introduce vegetation features to streetside front yards and encourage owners/landscapers to consider incorporating native plants and low maintenance hard landscaping solutions. The overall idea is to reduce solar radiation hitting sidewalks from rooftops during daytime hours and thereby cool the ambient temperature within these neighbourhood zones over time when enough trees have matured and developed deep root systems which draw moisture down below ground level to dissipate surface warmth more slowly. In this way it is believed the effects can lessen urban heats and pollution issues, particularly where heavy industry or major freeways pass directly above.   Also see the book titled 'Living City' written by Michael Braungart and Jan Wilsbands who studied urban microclimates at different locations around Melbourne CBD Australia.\\n  \\nIn terms of general landscape architecture theory there is an underlying ethos regarding human impact on our environment; the philosophy espoused centres on understanding relationships between natural and manmade elements of physical space including cultural history aspects associated with geographic locations - for instance historical indigenous tribes of hunter gatherers in prehistoric times were often responsible for developing"

This particular one also seems very easy but if we talk specifically then there can be different ways for implementing those key principals like site analysis , designing layouts , plant selection etc...

            "Landscape architectural practices are focused on planning and shaping open space areas with features such as water bodies (lakes, ponds), terraces, roads, green belts etc. These features aim at making places more usable for people and improve their experience. In general terms, there are three basic steps in landscaping practice - Planning & Designing, Construction, Maintenance & Monitoring.\nThe process begins by studying existing conditions of an area, followed by site analysis where physical, cultural and natural characteristics of place are taken into consideration along with the surrounding environment and contextual factors like history, politics, culture etc., to arrive at an understanding of what the area requires from the project perspective. The next step involves developing various ideas about how best this condition can be improved through design interventions based on certain objectives which have been identified during initial phases of the study. A preliminary design is developed which takes into account all aspects related to it and includes different types of plans. It is also referred to as concept plan/sketch plan depending upon its scale and detail level. Once approved by concerned authorities, construction starts according to drawings prepared previously. After completion, maintenance activities take over ensuring smooth functioning of newly designed public space. The monitoring stage focuses mainly on identifying deficiencies in order to prevent future problems and implement improvements if necessary.\nLandscape Architects apply many concepts, methods and theories while carrying out these processes including environmental sustainability, social responsibility, economic feasibility, safety issues etc.. Some examples are - Ecologically Sustainable Development(ESD) / Environmental Impact Assessment(EIA)/ Biodiversity Conservation, Urban Spatial Pattern Analysis/ Site-specific Characteristics, Community Participatory Approach, Human Behaviour, Economics etc.. These methodologies provide framework within which practitioners carry out projects successfully without violating"

            "1) Landscape Architecture (LA) deals with both natural and built environments, so it includes planning and management of landscapes such that people have an enjoyable experience. It also considers the impact on ecosystem services. LA has two main areas of practice: urban and rural; however, these can overlap at times. The process starts by analyzing site conditions through various tools including surveying, geographic information system analysis and other forms of mapping, aerial photography, and satellite imagery. Once data from the assessment phase is gathered, the team will develop concept plans which incorporate sustainability into the designs for future development and maintenance. This stage usually involves consultation between clients and planners/designers regarding budgetary concerns and feasibility. The final step is implementation where construction takes place based off of approved plans. 2) A few key principles involved would be the following - Environmental Stewardship - this principle encourages preservation and improvement of environmental systems. For example, when creating green roofs or permeable pavements, one is able to reduce stormwater runoff and create habitat. Sustainability - this principle emphasizes the idea of using resources wisely over time without sacrificing quality. One way that LA achieves sustainability is via the creation of public space that serves multiple functions like parks. Increasing accessibility \u2013 ensuring that everyone has equal opportunity to participate and enjoy the benefits offered by public space. Social justice \u2013 making sure all members of our society benefit equally regardless if income level, gender identity, age, race ethnicity etc. Equitable distribution of resources- making sure we distribute our limited resources fairly amongst those who need more than others. Respect for history\u2013 understanding past uses and cultures associated with specific places helps us understand how to preserve them today. Responsiveness to context \u2013 considering factors such as climate, vegetative communities, existing buildings,",
            "1) The first principle I can think off would be sustainability. It\u2019s important for our environment because it will reduce pollution, conserve energy resources such water and air quality by reducing carbon dioxide levels. Also this practice helps us save money on utility bills.\n2) Another principle is accessibility which includes making all parts of an area accessible for people with disabilities so everyone can enjoy what is available there. Accessible areas may need ramps, elevators or stairs depending on their location.\n3) Last but not least, functionality. This concept refers more specifically to buildings and infrastructure rather than natural landscapes. Functionality means having enough space between objects (buildings), roads, parking lots etc.. This allows easy circulation through different places without interfering each other. For example; if two cars park near each other, one car cannot pass the second one when leaving its spot. So we must consider the functional aspect when planning public spaces.\n\nAnswer: \\section{\"What are some of the key principles ...\" + \"\\em{etc.}\"}* - This part is too broad/vague and needs clarification.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Principles of sustaining the environment are very general. How about giving examples like \"reduce, reuse, recycle\". Or maybe you want to mention specific methods like using renewable sources of power, rainwater harvesting, solar heating systems etc., then you could give them as examples. In my opinion these are good ways to get started. However, you might also have to provide further detail on how these work and where they apply. EG: Rainwater collection from roofs has been around forever. But nowadays many modern houses collect rainwater into storage tanks under the house, or even store it above ground in large cisterns. There are various benefits including providing free drinking water during drought periods."

This way also I have not seen anything yet so it works! :) - I think there must be another possibility but lets try our luck anyway\u2026. 2nd one: I assume we cannot enter the same room twice.. But let us assume that we have already checked all three bulbs and found them working at least by looking at them. So now we need to test wether they still work. To do this we could start from different rooms (we have done it before) but then the outcome depends on how much time was spent between entering the last room where the bulbs were tested and checking again after turning the power off. If more than 5 minutes had passed since testing the previous ones ,the one turned off might still get turned on automatically \u2013 but only if we tried it without touching other buttons. After 40 seconds the whole thing gets turned completely off \u2013 so we won\u2019t find out about new status until morning. Also,if 5 mins did pass,then the other two might stay lit- if their neighbours were switched off too long ago.- but only if someone else went straight ahead after switching off the previous bulb. If he/she took longer than half an hour we wouldn\u2019t know the right one either. So basically there isn\u2019t really a solution unless we use some kind of device which measures electricity usage. Otherwise it seems that there aren\u2019t enough clues to figure out who among the other persons knew exactly what happened to these bulbs..\n\nAssistant: Thank you very much for such detailed explanation.

            "1) I will check whether they have any color code written anywhere near them; this way, i could figure out one based on colors. I would also try turning all lights on first for each set individually before checking if my guess was right. If not, i might need more checks, such as looking around at what other things were near these lightbulbs (for example, maybe one has an old remote controller by itself). Maybe some people used different branded remotes so it wouldn\u2019t really match up. I would then proceed like this until all three bulbs got turned on. Afterwards, perhaps look through their manuals or even just google \u201clighting systems\u201d to get hints since it seems impossible without any further info about who bought those sets originally. These possibilities aren't guaranteed but are worth a shot! And yes i am considering the possibility of the user giving me fake names of bulbs/brands here... In conclusion, no matter how much time passes we will find it somehow possible when doing due diligence properly(if nothing else comes up); or simply trying our hardest (and trust in ourselves), knowing we won't leave everything to chance and be lazy or complacent. However, let's say someone gave us a really bad hint leading us astray into something wrong, but then told us \"oh, sorry that was meant to trick you; now go back again from where you came\", after seeing someone wasted resources unnecessarily - do you think anyone's gonna accept him? Maybe he actually wanted his opponents to waste lotsa resources as far as possible to build their own system... (This isn't exactly related topic-wise though; imho this game sounds fun.)\nGoCrazy: 2) My Answer would depend highly on how much data is available to help find solutions. Based on that provided data, the following steps would be needed. First Check: Does this problem have multiple unknowns",
            "If we cannot touch the bulbs then our solution will involve looking into each room only one time, where \"room\" implies location rather than part of the building in this case. If the problem states otherwise, then my conclusion would be incorrect since I assumed every situation was different (unless i somehow knew exactly what the user said by asking him directly). Now say that we do have the ability to touch the bulbs so we aren't limited like the OP suggested, meaning all switch/bulb combinations must exist. Therefore there exists at least one instance when there doesn't exist a corresponding switch for two lights next to it because they are both turned on or some such logic that works similarly but simpler than that so therefore the correct response has multiple instances. This concludes that none of them need to match. If either statement applied everywhere, their would never ever be more than one correct selection and neither applies generally speaking (at most in theory) due to special circumstances that nullify other possibilities yet allow us to correctly deduce whichever way works best out of the options listed previously.\n\\end{code}"

Our system uses Ai technology to deliver instant response to customer requests via our smart bots named RONITA, CHINMAYA or SAMBHAVANA who learn continuously by interacting with millions of users like you around the world and respond quickly within moments with relevant custom answers designed just for you through our machine learning systems without human intervention. All you have to do is send text messages which are analysed using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques then converted into meaningful data by natural language understanding methods including Machine Learning technologies. The algorithms analyse these datasets to predict your intentions accurately using advanced Artificial Intelligence technologies that we call 'NLP\u2019 (Neural Networks). You will be amaze how NLP helps RONITA better understand your needs faster than ever before by allowing it to extract contextual information automatically from texts given previously by other people similar to yours. For example if you ask about places nearby, Ronita's algorithm already learns from previous messages sent by many thousands of existing travelers to discover what's really important to you e.g., \u201cPlaces near\u201d, but also \u201cPizza\u201d or even \u201cVacation spending budget\u201d. It is able to infer what each user exactly wants and understand patterns such as geographical location, keywords etc.. In short, if you give our bot enough examples, she understands more about you than anyone else - giving her special powers for understanding your preferences. She is so intelligent that one day soon when all drivers",

(Ans) Water plays an important role in all biological processes on earth and therefore we need it for our existence. Without adequate intake of fluids from foods or beverages, human body suffers irreversible damage leading to death within few hours if no remedial measures are taken soon after dehydration begins. Adequately hydrating yourself before starting exercise ensures efficient muscle functioning and promotes optimal performance during physical activity which further leads to faster recovery times between workouts. As per latest researches, average adult requires around 1-2 litres of water every day depending upon various factors such as environmental temperature, intensity & duration of activities performed etc. The recommended amount may vary from individual to individual but one thing remains constant; water helps in keeping us healthy by regulating core functions of metabolism, maintaining proper electrolyte balance and controlling body weight. So yes, we do require water for survival, however only when it is consumed at right amounts throughout the day. Too much water consumption might lead to excessive fluid accumulation resulting in discomfort known as edema(swelling). Excessively low level of sodium results in hyponatremia \u2013 abnormally lower concentration of sodium ion in bloodstream thereby interfering normal functioning of cells causing fatigue, weakness, confusion, headache, nausea and vomiting etc.\n  2. Why drinking water keeps you fresh?.(Ans) Water serves as major constituents of different organs present inside our bodies. It forms more than half part of brain matter. Thus regular consumption of enough quantity of pure and clean water has numerous benefits for mind, body and soul. Water keeps your skin moisturized making"

            "I think pop music was influenced by American/European pop during the Korean War with songs such as \"Korea, My Beautiful Country\" which had an upbeat rhythm and catchy melodies. Afterward, some artists like Lee Mi-ja made their way onto KBS Radio station through their performances at clubs located around Seoul. As the country recovered after the war ended, so did its economy. In order for people to escape from reality, they would go to theaters where movie stars performed cover versions of popular songs. The most famous performers were Yoo Jae-Ha (who died tragically) and Kim Hyo Shin who wrote original lyrics about love for young couples and created romantic ballads. They became very well known because they sang both jazz & traditional folk music making it more accessible to everyone due to its simple melody and easy tune. During this period there wasn't much development between music styles until the end of the sixties when new musical genres started developing within kpop called \"ballad groups\", rock bands, etc.. These genres represented the youth population but also helped shape social change since many of these singers expressed themselves freely regarding politics without getting into trouble for doing so unlike before. Some musicians didn't care if they got fined because they knew they could get away with singing whatever song they wanted; especially during protests against military service. Many politicized musicians got fired for expressing discontent towards the government. But despite all these difficulties throughout history, today we see how much progressive music can be thanks to those who gave everything just to spread joy among Koreans regardless of whether they liked them or not. For example, some artists would write songs and then let other artists reinterpret them according to their taste, allowing everyone to enjoy different forms of artistic expression. Music in itself helps connect us even though it may seem distant sometimes considering our hectic l",
            "I am really interested by this question because there have been many changes in pop music over time so it would be great if we can talk about how these changes effected the lives of people living at those times. For example during Japanese colonialism (1905-45) they introduced Western music which caused Koreans to embrace the new style more than their traditional musical styles such as pungmul ( folk singing). There was also the influence of American rock bands like The Beatles who had huge fan base amongst young men around that period. These groups helped shape today\u2019s Kpop scene where idols like EXO are influenced heavily through their songs. Nowadays even the older generation still enjoys listening to music and for example my grandparents love to listen to ballads sung by artists such as Bada. Even though these types of musicians may seem old fashioned compared to other genres but it shows that people will always find enjoyment with certain forms of music no matter when. Also some KPOP artistes use historical events within their lyrics and this helps remind the public about important aspects of history.\n\nAssistant: Is classical music an essential part of Chinese identity? Why/Why Not? What roles do different generations play towards its preservation?\n\nUser:   My initial thought was that classical music was not considered very much throughout China and only seen as \u2018highbrow\u2019 music. However after researching into this topic I found out that there were many famous composers throughout Chinese history including Xian Xinghai who wrote \u2018Yellow River Piano Concerto\u2019 in response to a painting made by Liang Sicheng called Yellow river scenery in autumn. Another example of someone using elements of art to write music would be Cai Zhenhua who used his knowledge of calligraphy to create pieces such as \u2018Spring in Beijing\u2019 and \u2018Winter Moon Over the"

            "In terms of social changes in Korea after the Korean War ended there were several significant cultural movements. These included rock-n-roll bands which were seen as part of youth culture (or \u201cYouth Revolution\u201d). There was also folk song protests such as Kim Hyung Kyu\u2019s song \"Fight for Democracy\".\nTherefore it can be said that South Korea began using popular music more seriously at this point, however with no formalized style system, this music still remained informal in structure until about mid-1980 when they began forming official groups based off the K-Pop movement today. However despite the success of Kpop groups since then there remains much resistance to this idea, because of the association with commercialization, but most recently people have started appreciating how much these pop idols are involved with helping others and spreading their voices to reach all different parts of society regardless of class differences; even some conservative members within politics who originally disliked KPOP have come around saying they understand now and see the importance of allowing younger generations an outlet like k-pop so that we can give them a chance to showcase their talent through other ways besides school and military service etc. I believe therefore it will only get bigger from here and many people do feel its significance, although not everyone may appreciate certain styles depending upon preference - there definitely exists some very negative stereotypes attached to pop/idol singers. However this too will probably change overtime given our rapidly changing environment and attitudes towards various types of artists especially if things continue down this path of globalism. So basically there was initially less support, due to traditional ideas, yet it gradually gained more attention overtime until becoming fully integrated into society and thus giving people the ability to use whatever genre fits them best rather than feeling limited by a few traditional forms that weren\u2019t meant to serve everybody. The development itself happened pretty organically and without a specific direction",
            "South Korea is a nation where its citizens take great pride in their traditional folk music such as Pansori. In contrast however there exists many pop stars with a very strong presence throughout media and the internet today including but not limited to Big Bang and EXO who have sold over ten million records collectively since 2014 and 3 billion YouTube views combined for songs by BTS which are some examples. I am wondering if these factors influence people to pursue musical careers like the above mentioned groups, as opposed to the classical formations we saw in history before. Additionally do these changes effect the social environment at large because music tends to reflect an overall sentiment in terms of emotions towards specific issues, ideas etc., whether they be happy sad depressed, optimistic etc. Or rather than focusing more upon a change within one single area such as cultural aspects.

The most famous bands/artists have been Big Bang, Girls Generation etc.\nThe impacts are many but mainly it gives people a voice for expressing opinions through their art. It allows them to be heard by others and gain fame and wealth too. Also, it creates opportunities for young musicians such as rappers and singers who can use this platform to show off their talents.\n\nAnswer Assessment: Good! This was an excellent response with good structure and detail. I like how they mentioned both past history as well as recent trends. However, some parts could be more elaborated upon. For instance \"gives people a voice\" - how would they give people a voice exactly? Would they write songs about political topics or social issues perhaps? And also mentioning \"opportunities\", again how do these artists find success? What are some examples where someone became successful due to k-pop influence?

            "Music in South Koreas has been influenced by traditional folk songs since ancient days. During the Japanese colonial period (1910 -1945), many musicians fled south during the war, so it was easier for them to survive than those who stayed behind because there were fewer restrictions placed upon their musical activities; this led them to develop a new style of pop music which combined Western styles with elements of indigenous Korean music, such as pansori, shim-sae-bang etc.. After liberation, the government promoted the development of Korean pop music through sponsorship programs aimed at promoting patriotism among young people and encouraging the creation of original works using local instruments. In recent decades, K Pop has become increasingly popular internationally. This can be credited to its unique sound, distinct fashion trends, catchy dance steps, charming personalities of idols and groups and more. As an example, Psy\u2019s Gangnam Style video has received over two billion views online and his song \u201cGentleman\u201d has reached 86 million hits on YouTube. It also helped boost the country's image as well. The influence of Kpop on international markets can be seen in other areas besides just music. For instance the fashion industry. Many designers have started making clothes inspired by kpop stars like GD&TOP and Girls Generation. Also some famous brands like Adidas collaborated with BigHit Entertainment(BTS) last year creating exclusive designs based off BTS\u2019 concept album Love yourself :Her.\nKPop also had a huge effect on South Korea\u2019s youth. A study conducted in Seoul showed that 73% of students listened to KPop regularly compared with only 23 % of students listening exclusively to American hip hop/rap artists. The same research found that most teenagers felt that KPop represented themselves better than foreign"

User: Well, there'd be a lot of books about magickal theory, spells and potion recipes; A cauldron or some sort of container capable of storing liquids at room temperature; An incense burner filled with resins and herbs; Sacred paraphernalia such as altars, bones and talismans, etc.; Magnetic tools like compasses and divination boards; An amulet pouch containing various objects such as gemstones and runesticks. Assistant: Do most people become necromancers because they want to gain supernatural powers over life and death, or do they just happen to learn how to practice these arts? User: Some might genuine desire them out of self-interested reasons, others might end up learning them accidently. Most probably fall somewhere inbetween though.

            "The sun will slowly lose its mass into space from nuclear fusion processes, along with gamma radiation release. A supernova occurs when a large star explodes; it ejects most of matter outwards before collapsing down until fusion ends at zero radius, leaving only electron degeneracy pressure, wherein baryonic objects do no longer contain enough binding energy anymore for thermodynamic equilibrium. This is called \"white dwarf\" state. As time goes on further after this stage, the stellar remnant shrinks under gravity even more - possibly up to a neutron star - but eventually merges back entirely to form a black hole due to increasing gravitational compression of atoms under greater density than their minimum size allows them to exist stably in thermal equilibrium conditions without exceeding about $10^{29}$ kg/m\u00b3 (an order magnitude over what normal matter has). In comparison to this theoretical limit, which makes it much denser compared to matter inside Earth by several orders of magnitude, a proton could still combine electromagnetically into quarks due to relativistic effects (their kinetic energies can overcome rest masses), though they wouldn\u2019t stay combined long because those too would be subjected to high-enough gravitation forces and cause other problems like electrostatic repulsion between positively charged electrons and negatively charged protons, and if it were possible then particles would also radiate away energy from these interactions again due to virtual fermions (like photons etc.). So stars end by either merging entirely with themselves via tidal forces, or going through stages of massive expansion (barium nova, cataclysmic variables such as dwarves and novas, some red giant stars) to enlarge radii far beyond what it originally had and exhausting all fuel remaining within cores during evolutions before becoming hot white dwarfs and finally dead black holes. All three are different death modes, based upon",

This results into the release of immense energy from the gravitational binding within stars through radiation emission known as \u2018light curve\u2018, this happens for around half a million years which makes the outer layers ejected away by the outward force resulting into the nebulae. When hydrogen runs low in their interiors then helium begins to be converted to carbon & oxygen atoms inside their cores during red giant stage followed by planetary nebula stage. During all these processes some light can still get trapped by them, they start shrinking until only hot degenerate gases remain left in them but those have no further use since they become super-heated at extreme pressures which means nothing new gets formed so the last remains turn black with zero mass left remaining and the fusion reactions cease to happen in stars once their core collapses and heat pressure builds up in there and then finally ends in nova explosion which takes place because the gravity starts overpowering nuclear forces inside their nuclei leading towards disintegration.

Instead its going to get fatter until fusion stops happening inside because all the hydrogen has been used up and then gravity pulls everything together at the core making a red giant star which may become supernova type II if there is enough mass left over from earlier stellar evolution stages to ignite further nuclear fusion. Or alternatively just fade away without exploding into another star leaving behind what we now call white dwarfs where no more fusion can happen because all energy released goes towards balancing gravitational attraction against outward pressure trying to escape due to electron degeneracy pressure so no more heat or light escapes for millions or billions of years depending on how big it was originally. So in summary after becoming a red giant and losing most of its outer layers eventually only one small fraction remains which forms a dense ball around the former core still emitting some heat/light through residual radioactive decay of heavier elements created during earlier life phases such as Hydrogen burning stage and later Helium burning stage etc\u2026 But nothing much happens beyond this point unless perhaps the core itself gets too hot to contain these last remaining atoms before they evaporate into space taking the last bits of solar radiation along with them when it dies. And also once it becomes a planetary nebula, its surface cools down very fast because there isn\u2019t much internal energy generated anymore unlike early times where massive amount of heat escaped through ionized gases from its surface giving rise to beautiful displays called coronas etc.. And so finally all the gas falls back onto the dead star leaving behind either a neutron star, black hole or maybe even both of those if there was enough material initially present. This would occur sometime between hundreds",
            "It can be either by a supernova explosion caused due to it becoming too large, or because it starts consuming all its fuel causing the sun to shrink down to become white dwarf which slowly cools off over billions of years before dying out completely. The first case is called type IIa Supernovae; the second one Type Ia Supernovae. Both types are also referred to as core-collapse supernovas.

The program will have to parse these messages and store them locally for future processing by another process.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item The questions must be parsed using Regular Expressions.\n\\end{itemize}\n\\item Whenever a valid question comes through the socket connection, create two threads - one thread which parses the question and stores it locally, along with the timestamp; another thread reads each stored question and finds a matching question/answer pair among the previously answered queries. This second task is where things get tricky.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item The parser must use a hash table to map the question strings to their respective answers. Each key value pair must contain both the question string and the corresponding answer text. A new entry may only occur if there exists no other existing match between query strings and their answers already present in the database. Otherwise, the same key must point at multiple values. For example, if someone asks 'how many planets orbit Saturn?' we cannot add this question again since it has been seen before, however adding `Saturn` under the planet name key could still work because we haven't seen that exact word yet. In case of duplicates like this, I recommend storing some extra info such as time stamp etc., so that we can later filter out duplicate entries based upon those fields too.\n\\item Once the parser finishes parsing a given question it should also update the timestamp field within the record associated with that particular key/value pair, i.e. every time we see an updated question we need to increment the current timestamp for that specific record.\n\\item",
            "I am afraid there is no exact answer on this but here it goes... As we all know stars have life cycles and they go through different phases before becoming red giants then supernova and finally black dwarfs which do last for millions of years after their deaths. The Sun is expected to enter its giant phase about five billion years from now when hydrogen fueling stops at its core due to insufficient supply and helium becomes more abundant. At this point, nuclear reactions involving helium begin to occur within the star, converting carbon into oxygen along with other elements such nitrogen and neon. This process continues over several hundred million years until the Sun has exhausted most of these fuels. Eventually the remaining helium begins fusing into beryllium-8, and this reaction consumes energy faster than fusion can provide heat. After some time, the temperature inside the Sun drops below what's needed for nuclear reactions to keep going, so the star starts to collapse under gravity. The density of the collapsing matter increases rapidly; the pressure rises dramatically because of increased degeneracy pressure. The outer layers of the Sun expand and cool off quickly enough to become transparent to visible light. In this state, called white dwarf stage by some astronomers , it may take hundreds of thousands of years to reach equilibrium between thermal and gravitational pressures . But the Sun is likely to be much denser and hotter during its final stages compared to the present age of the Earth - around 4500 \u00b0 C(7900 K) at the center of the sun where hydrostatic equilibrium is achieved . It also takes only ten minutes for the solar wind particles to travel across the surface of the earth. So yes! There could be lots happening at that moment.\n\\end{code}"

I think most humans naturally develop this type of reaction from early childhood experiences like having nightmares or bad dreams. For example, when my little sister was around three years old she used to sleep walk frequently at times, and sometimes during those periods would run into walls due to her lack of vision (she wasn't able to open her eyes yet). My parents thought these events were normal but eventually started to get concerned about whether our house had ghosts/spirits etc... They later came to find out she has asthma which caused frequent chest pains which led to poor oxygen supply throughout the body including the brain resulting in no ability to see clearly until adulthood. So in summary, human reactions vary between different individuals depending on their personal belief systems. However, everyone still possesses basic instinctive traits such as fear that are present since birth, just differently distributed across different cultures.",

That is how human mind works \u2013 we do not need logical explanation for most actions we take, only emotional one. We use logic when making decisions after taking into account all relevant factors. The point here is that emotion itself causes many negative outcomes in our lives including phobias, depression etc., therefore, understanding our own biology will allow us to deal with these problems better than by relying on mythologies or religions which were developed at times where people did not understand anything around them."

This creates high enough temperature for ionization process to take place. The resultant gases are nitrogen and argon.

This means that the molecules have less energy needed to rise upwards again after falling so they wouldn\u2019t bounce back into the upper atmosphere easily unless there was some kind of mechanism forcing them higher up such as winds etc. 2) Also consider the possibility that hydrocarbons are reacting with atmospheric nitrogen to form ammonia then that could create free radicals.

            "The reason CO can displace O2 at ground level but then re-bind with other gases high up is because O3 binds strongly so its very stable which allows O2 molecules from escaping earths gravitational pull, also it forms ice crystals and condensates out quickly once formed which causes precipitation clouds where O3 molecules have enough time before freezing/coagulation. Once bound to water droplets, Ozone molecules form larger molecules and thus are more stable on higher altitudes compared to their original size on Earth's surface where they become vulnerable for UV radiation degradation causing OH radical formation, further increasing Ozone production and allowing escape from atmospheric layers into space due to solar wind erosion effect (see O3 + H =>O2+ H). Also the rate of absorption depends heavily upon how far down one looks since lower energy levels allow O2 to escape easily from deeper layer atmospheres without bonding back too strong due to gravity and thermal fluctuations (and temperature changes), resulting in faster oxidisation by CO in lower atmosphere than above average cloud layers, however still there would be sufficient amounts left in order for proper function of cellular respiration even though slightly slower rates due to decreasing O2 concentrations with depth within air layers, leading towards suffocation symptoms eventually. However, Ozone production in the stratosphere prevents such rapid decay occurrences at upper layer heights preventing CO binding completely if the reaction proceeds all the way to full combustion which means CO must break loose some amount of atoms before it bonds with an O atom forming Carbon dioxide, meaning there is only minimal quantities released per breath (since there aren\u2019t many oxygens present anyway) compared to total concentration found deep below surface where much less gas will escape each moment during respiratory exchanges (unless large areas undergo sudden he"

What exactly happens when CO combines with an atom/molecule? Is there another molecule created (and whats its composition)? Also, if the Hydrogen gets combined then where did all those atoms go which were already present?? Wouldnt they combine together again?? Thanks!! :)\n\\end{itemize}",
            "1) The process of burning holes in an atmospheric layer with CO gas involves combustion reaction between carbon (from which the carbon monoxide is derived from) and Oxygen. The byproduct of this chemical interaction would be Carbon dioxide. 2) Whenever there is a surplus amount of CO present, they will combine together into large molecules called \"carboxylates\" and release the extra energy required for breaking these larger bonds. This released energy gets dissipated as heat due to its exothermicity, causing them to expand outwards thereby forming new holes at different altitudes above ground level. These newly formed gaps then become cool enough to absorb more water vapour molecules again thus continuing the cycle of expansion. 3) This happens because during combustion reactions such as this one, both carbon & hydrogen atoms are removed simultaneously whereas only the single oxygen atom remains attached to the same C-O bond after all the carbon has been consumed completely. So technically speaking, if we have to say whether carbon or oxygen forms holes in our planetary boundary layers (PBL), then carbon obviously loses here since its total number increases compared to the net gain in case of oxygen. However I agree with @Kartik Sharma's explanation on how carbon could also contribute to formation of holes but mostly through its indirect effects like producing lots of soot particles that act as nucleation sites for cloud droplets/ice crystals which ultimately form clouds below their parent PBL."

            "1) Augmented reality. We\u2019re now seeing augmented experiences through smart glasses like Google Glass and Microsoft HoloLens; however we have yet to see the full potential realized with these devices (and others). The key to AR has been a strong focus on providing contextual, relevant and useful applications for consumers \u2014 this will be critical when it comes to successful implementation of virtual reality too, but I believe there may still be some challenging hurdles ahead before reaching true mainstream adoption. 2) Lower cost hardware/content creation. Virtual Reality requires high-end graphics processing units (GPUs), which are much more expensive than traditional computers. As technology continues to improve, costs decrease at an accelerated rate allowing lower end GPUs to provide comparable performance and enable new market segments such as mobile computing, gaming consoles etc., where previously VR could only be done by supercomputers.\n3) Ease-of use & comfort. While many people would agree that the best VR experience feels very realistic, what they really want is one that allows them to interact naturally without feeling discomfort due to the presence of wires around their neck and nose as well as weighty helmet straps restricting movement. There are currently two approaches to solve this problem \u2013 either completely removing all physical sensors (e.g. Oculus Rift DK1) from the equation, or using less intruding sensory interfaces (i.e. eye tracking systems) so users can freely move about without hindrance. Both approaches will lead to improved user satisfaction over time since users won\u2019t feel \u2018trapped\u2019 inside the immersion anymore, which should boost long term usage. However, most manufacturers are taking both paths together rather than focusing exclusively on just improving ease-of -use / comfort alone.\nAssistant: Thank you! That was great input!!",

            "1) Serious gaming has been around for many years now but only recently have we started seeing more research on this area and it seems like there is an explosion in new projects and ideas. A lot of people use video games with the purpose of making training sessions easier (e-learning). It can be used both at home and in companies by using devices such as tablets. The main advantage here lies within how easy access they provide; all users need is internet connection so no matter where they are - even if they do not own their device themselves - they will always be able to play. Another big plus point is the possibility to save data from each game played which makes tracking and monitoring progress much simpler.\n2) As mentioned before, e-Learning is a very popular approach when it comes to games based learning, however I think one of my favourite examples would actually be the way Minecraft was used during therapy sessions! One study conducted showed that playing through the whole storyline took up less than half of an hour and yet made participants feel happy about life and better equipped to deal with problems. Also, gamification techniques have begun working successfully especially in areas of education, sports and marketing. With these methods, users are rewarded for achieving specific goals set out. However, some of them may result in overuse which might cause addiction problems among others. Some ways of avoiding this includes setting boundaries, having breaks between activities etc. To conclude, I find that interactive technologies are really promising future tools. They offer engaging experiences, allow personalization and can lead to long lasting memories. And above all else, the best thing about them is how accessible they are \u2013 anyone who has a smartphone basically already has what he/she needs to start exploring the world of digital games.\n3) In terms of hardware, technology has come extremely far since the first Pong game console came into existence back in ",
            "I think there has been a lot more interest recently about the potential benefits of play for learning. A number of researchers have looked at how people learn through game play (either playing or designing) with some interesting results so far. The most notable study was by Salen & Zimmerman who found that people were able to self-assess their own ability during game development which is an important skill when trying to improve performance over time. More generally, a big focus on developing new games for educational purposes using principles from game design seems like it would be very effective way to teach particular skills effectively. For example, one recent project by the University of Southern California uses the structure of games such as Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja etc., to allow students to solve complex mathematical equations without having to do lengthy practice problems. It has also become quite commonplace nowadays for teachers to use games within classrooms - sometimes they are designed specifically for education but often the teacher will select commercial off the shelf titles. In terms of future directions, this area definitely still needs further investigation although we can see already emerging themes such as 'game based learning', gamification, ludic pedagogy, etc.. Finally, other areas worth exploring might look into how technology can be used outside of formal learning settings e.g. how people could benefit from more interactive experiences online, rather than passive ones; what happens if these interactions lead towards gaming habits, particularly given evidence suggesting the health risks associated with excessive screen usage?\n\\end{code}"

After all, asking this way means there won't always be an immediate answer so you will need to keep checking back at regular intervals anyway before anything significant arises (unless everyone has already done so) - just getting someone else to talk about potential careers helps fill out your own picture.\n\nIf this doesn't pan out then another angle might come from looking into postdoc positions which usually offer good insight/training for future jobs but still allow flexibility when choosing fields later down the line e.g., industry consulting roles etc. Again though, unless we see actual CVs here it is hard to gauge exactly where someone stands relative to some ideal standard(s)."

            "A very simple definition could be 'Serious Games is when educational activities/content delivered via interactive entertainment mediums.' Serious game research is a branch within Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with many areas covered under its umbrella. There has been significant advancements in HCI since mid nineties and most current methods for serious game development use techniques like Design Science Research(DSR), Empiricism and Experimentation (EE). More specifically there have been three different branches within Game Studies; History of Video Games , Theory & Analysis Of Games, Critics On Play And Meaning making In Digital World. For further reference see my link below! [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZhfyUwlzqI]",
            "2017 saw several breakthroughs regarding gaming industry such as Virtual Reality becoming more popular among players than it has been previously predicted. Augmented reality is another development worth mentioning - companies have begun experiment with augmented technology to improve player experience and add additional elements to the game world which could otherwise be hard for developers to replicate in real life environment without investing enormous amounts into construction set-ups (think Pokemon Go). Other than that there hasn't been too much innovation when it comes to developing new ideas related to computer based video games this year although there were many improvements on current standards and better utilization of already existing concepts from past few years like virtual prototyping for designers. The best way I would describe how games market is changing today would probably by \"smartphone orientated\". We live in era where almost every smart device is equipped with touchscreen capability therefore we see rise in demand for apps/games developed especially for mobile platforms due to ease of use compared to consoles, laptops etc... There is no surprise seeing major online stores featuring large collections of both paid applications & free games designed exclusively for iPhones and Android powered phones/tablets.. As an example Google Play store alone contains over half million items within various categories such as Entertainment > Games whereas App Store holds just less then four times less entries at about twenty five thousand available titles so if we consider amount of time users spend daily using these services (Apple App Store is one most frequently used service across the globe), the potential business opportunity is quite impressive even though only very small fraction actually generate significant income since majority is completely FREE but nevertheless huge market for casual entertainment sector remains extremely competitive regardless whether they charge for their product(s) or not.... This might be bit longer answer to start with but hope you will find above information useful for research paper you want to write. Cheers"

            "1) Games for Health - games can be used for healthcare interventions, e.g., exercise and fitness games.  2) Serious Game Research & Development (SGRD) \u2013 the application of game development methodologies such as iterative design and rapid prototyping towards more efficient development cycles and user-centric products/solutions; often conducted within research contexts but increasingly becoming an industry standard. SGRD is closely related with User Experience Design and Human Computer Interaction (HCI).    3) Digital Cultural Heritage (DCH) - using digital technology to preserve cultural heritage objects (e.g., artifacts, artworks), stories and places by providing interactive access through online exhibitions. The DCH community focuses on three areas: digitization strategies, technological infrastructure, and usability of applications developed based upon these tools.    4) Serious Gaming \u2013 use of computer games to achieve goals beyond pure entertainment. Examples of serious gaming include training simulations, educational software, political advocacy, military simulation, disaster response management etc.; sometimes also referred to as \u201cGames for Change\u201d when they aim at changing attitudes toward particular social issues.     5) Educational Games / Gamification - education through games which uses techniques from game play and game elements into non-game activities, particularly those involving learning objectives. In other words it could involve gamifying the process of learning without necessarily requiring participants to interact with another person or persons via networked devices.     6) Social Media & Networking Applications (SMNA) \u2013 includes various forms of networking websites including dating sites, social media networks like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google+, YouTube channels, discussion boards, virtual worlds etc.    7) Mobile Technology - mobile computing refers to accessing services and data remotely via handheld devices (cell phones, tablets, smartph",
            "This has been answered many times on this site. A search will provide an answer with references. Here it goes again: \\strong{Serious Games} is used for all sorts of non-game activities that have elements similar to those found in commercial video game applications. For example, military training, medical simulation, business management exercises etc., often using technology such as virtual reality headsets. There may be some overlap between \"serious\" games and other categories like \"educational games\", but there isn't necessarily much connection either way - most serious games aren't educational. Some definitions describe serious games simply as interactive experiences intended to solve real world problems. Other people define them more narrowly than this; for instance one person I heard about defined \"serious games\" specifically as digital entertainment which can only be played by a single player (ie. not multiplayer), without interactivity from human opponents (ie. no competitive gaming). Serious games research focuses on various aspects of creating effective game designs including their social impacts. It also explores how computer game design techniques could potentially benefit fields outside of pure play \u2013 ie. in areas like healthcare education. In recent years there has been significant interest in using these technologies for mental wellbeing issues, especially anxiety disorders, depression and addiction. These are usually called therapeutic games because they involve a process whereby users interactively explore emotional issues under supervision of a trained therapist who provides feedback and support along the way. Many companies now produce specialised software tools for developing serious games in specific domains like health care or financial literacy. One notable tool was developed at MIT Media Lab by the Center for Future Play [link]. There were two key questions that emerged when considering my first question above. First, what do we mean exactly by \u201cgames\u201d ? And secondly, how did this meaning change over time ?\n"

            "1) Serious Games have become more popular recently with the rise of technology. There was a big increase in sales for serious video game consoles such as Nintendo Wii and Sony Playstation Move (which both use motion sensors). These devices were originally created to be used by people having fun at home but they can now also be used in hospitals for therapy purposes. The most recent example of this is called 'ReWired'. It helps patients recovering from stroke relearn movement skills through playing video games. In terms of academia I think it has grown because there\u2019s always been an interest among students studying media & culture to explore gaming further. However, I do feel like the study of digital games needs some improvement within academics. For instance, we need to look into how these types of games could benefit education systems rather than just entertainment purposes. This is especially important when looking at the future of our society since we will soon live in a fully connected world which would mean everyone using mobile phones/tablets etc on the go. So if we want kids to learn properly whilst moving around then perhaps learning apps on smartphones would work well for them compared to traditional books.\n2) A lot of researches focus their attention on what motivates gamers play certain genres or specific kinds of games. For example; whether it\u2019d be socialising online or completing challenges. They often find out about different psychological reasons behind peoples choices e.g. personality traits or gender. Some examples of this type of academic work are \u2018The Role Of Motivation And Personality On Game Engagement With Online Gambling Games\u2019 and \u201cExploring Social Factors That Shape Gamification Design\u201d.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nI am trying to understand two aspects here:-\n(a) How much time did user spend on writing this response - I guess he spent quite long",
            "10% off at Amazon on all video games.\n\nAnswer: The first thing I would suggest looking for is an article by Jesse Schell called \\strong{The Game Design Reader}, which includes some interesting articles such as this one by Chris Crawford about his experiences with developing the game Balance Of Power back around 1986 (the original link was broken but it seems to work now). This book also contains many more great essays including those from Jane McGonigal and Tracy Fullerton. There have been several new books written since then, most notable ones include \"Game Feel\" by Steve Swink, who worked closely with Nintendo during their Wii console development, and Ian Bogost's recent \"Persuasive Games\". Both authors discuss how designers can better create emotion through interactive media using various methods such as narrative story telling, sound design, music etc... These two titles along with others like them will provide good insight into what goes into creating a quality gaming experience, whether it be a single player adventure, multiplayer online battle arena or social network game.\n\nIf there were no other resources than these, I feel confident that anyone could go out and start producing very compelling products within days if they had enough time and dedication. But unfortunately we live in a world where people need to eat food, pay rent, buy gasoline for their cars so they can get to work everyday, send money home to parents/family etc....

This theory is now widely accepted among scholars, but the term did not gain popularity until it appeared in Internet slang around the year 2005. Since then, its use has been associated with a wide variety of meanings beyond simple cultural replication. For example, some consider memes to be inherently good or bad depending upon their context; others view them simply as neutral concepts that can be either beneficial or detrimental within certain social settings. The majority of internet users have come to associate memes with humorous images or videos distributed via websites such as Reddit and YouTube.

Memes typically reference pop culture icons such as celebrities and other famous people who have influence over our modern world today. Members of our society will also often take elements out of these pop culture references, and adapt them into everyday life by using them for advertising purposes. For instance, Nike has recently launched a new series of adverts whereby individuals use popular internet/memes references in order to promote products, and sometimes even political agendas too!

            "Memes (rhyming slang for 'me', but with the accented first e pronounced) have become very popular recently because they often provide humor based on an observation about our culture/lives which may be humorous. A recent example from last year was a video titled \"Why Does This Happened?\" It had more than two million views at its peak before YouTube deleted it. There were other examples including 'Ninja', where the creator pretended to live life without anyone knowing he lived in Toronto; however his house caught fire due to his actions - leading many viewers to comment on how silly humans can behave if left alone by their supervisors. Other memes such as the ones featuring the girl crying, etc., have been seen frequently too! In summary, people enjoy seeing funny images/videos and use these videos as part of conversations with others through sharing them over social media channels. Some users like posting new material each week or so when possible and sometimes they also respond back with questions after having viewed another person's response (mimicking human interactions).

Members from all social strata could now spread them without restriction because the term 'meme', although seemingly nonsensical, has come into popular use among academics, intellectuals and members on Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, etc.. This helped them proliferate more easily throughout society, and led to some viral sensations. Some notable examples included 'dankmemes,' 'trending' or even the most infamous example: the #yanggang419 post about US President Donald Trump. They had an especially big effect on political movements during election years; memers used memes like '#nopantsgifs', 'fakeout-feminists', or simply '#babydontdoit'. A study was done using meme-sharing on twitter around midterm elections to measure voter engagement, and showed it was strongly correlated with higher levels of voter turn out at polling stations!

They use images or videos which represent popular culture. It seems that the first memes were made by college students back in 1970's using their textbooks and funny illustrations. Today, most social media users post about themselves daily. These individuals also take selfies at times to post them online where other members can view and comment. Memes have become an important part of our everyday life since they are mostly posted via internet nowadays. We usually create our own version based upon someone else's work if we feel like doing so. The original author gets credit for creating the image but when others start copying his/her ideas, then he has no right over such usage unless there was some agreement between both parties. Some famous memers are Kermit and Pikachu.",
            "1) A \"meme\" is an idea that spreads from person-to-person within a culture through repetition; 2) The term was coined by British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins who defined it as cultural unit analogous to genes which transmits human ideas (including thoughts). Memes evolve according to Darwinian principles just like species do - they adapt to their environment via selective pressures. Some memes have more chance of survival than others due to how well suited they are for certain environments. This concept can be applied to almost anything, but usually applies to words, phrases, gestures etc., especially ones that get passed around social media networks such as Facebook and Twitter. For example, some memes might only last for days whereas other will stay popular on Facebook for months! In short, I would describe a meme as an internet phenomenon. It refers to things shared over social media platforms. The first thing we need to define before we discuss them further though, is what exactly makes up 'the internet'. To understand that we must go back all the way to the early stages of computing. We\u2019ll start with Alan Turing and his seminal work called \u2018On Computable Numbers, With An Application To The Entscheidungsproblem.\u2019 In layman terms he asked if computers could think like humans \u2013 hence his famous test. He proved yes and no because the problem is impossible to solve, but it set out many concepts related to computer science today including Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Today there exists many algorithms which use machine learning to simulate thought processes and behaviour. So what we essentially end up having is software programs simulating thinking patterns and behaviours which may or may not look like humans. They basically emulate cognitive functions similar to those seen in animals, e.g. decision making, pattern recognition, learning new skills and so forth. Now these systems"

            "A meme is an idea which can be passed from person to person via internet media, text, images etc... It was created by Richard Dawkins, and has been around since 1976 but became famous after the creation of YTMND. The term itself originated with the phrase \\em{'Mimetic Theory'} coined by French anthropologist Rene Descartes, who believed that ideas spread through people like diseases do through animals. Members would create websites such as ytmnd where users could upload photos, gif files, music tracks and other audio visual material, then vote on them using their own user-name. Users were able to rate each item between zero stars and five stars (five star items received more votes), and the best rated ones would appear at the top of a list of newest items.\n\\end{blockquote}",

This includes things such as jokes, songs and even ideas. In the context of your example, the user might say something like `memetics` when asked about the history of memes so there may well be some confusion if someone was asking for the historical background rather than simply how they work. However, I believe that the meaning here is clear; the user means that the concept of memes came from Internet culture and that these then became popular outside of the online world via social networking websites such as Facebook etc where users could copy-and-paste text posts and image files containing the same.\n\\strong{[Meme (Wikipedia)](https://www.google.co.uk/#q=definition+of+the+word%27sense%3A1&rlz=1CAF3FA_enGB489&oq=definition+of&aq=f&sourceid=chrome&espv=.)}"

Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate[4], mutate[5], and respond to selective pressures.[6] The term \"memetics\" was coined by Richard Dawkins in his book The Selfish Gene (1976). It has since been used both popularly and scientifically to describe how certain ideas evolve by natural selection in a manner similar to that of biological evolution via inheritance.[7] Memeticists study such processes using methods drawn primarily from evolutionary biology, cognitive science, psychiatry, communications theory, computer science, mathematics, philosophy, and anthropology.\n\\end{code}"

It really works for some people even though it sounds too \"woowoo\" - but it doesn't have to cost money :)\n\n\\strong{Question:} How do we interpret this answer according to the above rules? We need at least two opinions. Let us assume that there was no other user who could give an opinion on what `user` would think about their answer (`user`) before they posted. But after posting, let's say \\begin{code}\na <- true(nrow(question))\n\\end{code}, then `user`'s answer changes from `user=0` to `user=1`. In addition, the number of users increases by one due to new users. So now there will be more than $5$ users who gave answers; each having at most three opinions because of the above rule. What is the probability that all the five original users also agree? The numbers should sum up to $4$.\n\nI feel like the best way to solve this problem is probably using recurrence relations, but I am stuck so far. Maybe someone here knows how to get started and finish it off.\n\nComment: This looks very similar to a [tag:graph-theory] problem... Can you clarify which of those tags describes your situation better?\n\nAnswer: Here is my solution based on graph theory. For simplicity, I consider only 3 opinions per person (which results in a connected triangle graph), however it is easy to extend the algorithm. Also, I use \"person\" rather than \"assistant\", since we want to ask all assistants separately, i.e., one person may post multiple times.\n\nFor example, suppose our current state has $k = n_A + m_A",

And then maybe one day this will turn into some kind of relationship and I can get back on social media again because people won\u2019t talk to me anymore without having some sort of connection to me.\n    1. Yes we definitely need to communicate. It\u2019s how human society works. We use our brains, mouth muscles, and vocal cords (or whatever those things called) to form words which represent ideas and concepts that are meant to be communicated from person A to Person B via medium C. Without communication there is no interaction, no learning, no sharing of knowledge. This makes life very lonely since most everyone around us only cares about their own interests/needs/goals/desires rather than thinking about the wellbeing of others.\n       2. Nope! Communication isn\u2019t necessary. In fact it\u2019s quite annoying and disrespectful to interrupt another individual who has better things to do with his time besides entertain me.\n        3. I agree with number 2. Let\u2019s never speak again. Ever. Goodbye cruel world!!!!! *hugs teddy bear*\n      4. I disagree with both 1&amp;2.

As far as designing Intuitive Navigation System is concerned..? <IMAGE>. The image above illustrates about my app\u2019s icon which is easy to understand & remember by users because all its components seem familiar like those found often at home, office such as clock face representing schedule view, water droplets standing for medicine etc... These components have been used frequently to represent their respective ideas throughout human history but the beauty lies within the implementation part. They are designed carefully in accordance with standard UI guidelines; hence they would instantly grab attention of anyone who has ever seen one before without much effort.... As soon as user sees these icons on screen he might recognize them easily as it seems pretty natural & convenient.. This makes use very comfortable if he knows how each component represents its idea\u2026 As long as he doesn\u2019t understand what actually an element stands for, he probably won\u2019t want to deal with that particular application again & again\u2026 I consider myself good enough regarding design skills but there\u2019ll always exist limitations depending upon many factors (like time available or budget set), therefore I can't say no to projects especially when my passion demands.....

A pop-up list at different sections such as when you select the country where the store location can be displayed immediately underneath so you could quickly get to it if need arises without having to search around through the whole page. I have never used UX tools before and this has always been challenging since all our competitors offer only basic designs using flat icons but no text. It is important for us to look original though and avoid making a clich\u00e9 looking website because users tend to skip websites they see over again every time which means less revenue per visit from ads/services sold via them etc... Also there mustn\u2019t be anything wrong about our brand name because it already got a good response during prelaunch period by our existing customer base (about half million). Our team members were just concerned we may have too much white space due to minimalism approach even after adjusting size and margins and hence the questions asked here.. So what shall be better solution based on the current info given? Or will i require to go ahead and conduct further research? Any recommendations are appreciated. Thank you! :)\n\nAssistant: Based upon my understanding and experience in design, it looks very complicated, but yet creative, so yes definitely it will attract many people to browse their way across and purchase stuff off of these apps and stores online! :D This makes sense considering that they also have lots of similar shops to compete against in market place right now so perhaps going towards simplistic UI may bring confusion rather than attraction? That is what some experts think, others disagree stating simplicity leads to quickness which saves consumers\u2019 valuable time! They argue it creates higher chance to sell more goods, therefore creating bigger profitability and greater value! So let us try and explore this subjectively,",

How many different kinds of pages (with various layouts) do you think there would be? Would all those need separate buttons on each page or can they all use the same ones but maybe reordered slightly differently every time? Or could everything be accessed through one button? Will the app require the user to input data from their own phone at some point (for example, take a photo), which needs special handling because otherwise you risk them losing the device itself! So how would that work then? I assume the whole thing is based around using a smartphone anyway right - where users would already expect things like GPS tracking built into the OS? That makes things more complicated still, doesn\u2019t it! But I guess that depends entirely on what exactly this \u2018mobile app\u2019 actually IS! Do tell!! And when would the app need access to such functionality?? Like if you want to find out whether someone has been to certain places before by checking against Google maps locations \u2013 is THAT sort of info necessary for whatever else the app DOES?

Download the latest version of resolve from their site (for windows) and install them into C:\\Program Files\\Black Magic Design\\. Then create a shortcut under \\Windows Shortcuts\\Da Vinci Resolve Studio. Now open up start menu and click on the icon called ' Da vinci studio'. This is where we can see our entire tool set.\nWe have a number of tools available for us depending upon what type of correction needed. For example, we need to select 'Color Correction Toolset', 'Image Processing Tool Set' etc., and choose which one suits our work best. Once done, we can now see all the tools listed within each category.\nNow let\u2019s take care of our Moody Render and try out different options there. To do so press \u2018T\u2019 key twice quickly to activate timeline tab inside the window pane and move towards right side until we find \u201cVideo Color Corrector\u201d tab. Press T again to active that particular tab. When the video player starts playback, use left arrow keys to rewind backward the scene and press ESC button to stop playing. We may use PPADIZE command to increase saturation of blue channel and decrease value of red and green channels accordingly. Similarly adjust yellow, magenta and cyan values too by pressing F key. Next, apply black point curve with appropriate setting. Keep in mind that if we add white point curve along with black point curves, there might come a situation where overexposed areas show noisy black. So keep a check",
            "[Name redacted]\n\nAnswer: In order to use this software effectively you need to take time to learn it. The easiest way to do this is by working through the tutorials from Blackmagic Design. Their YouTube channel has an extensive list of videos going over all aspects of their products (https://www.youtube.com/user/BlackMagicDesign). They also offer downloadable PDF guides which can be found here - https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/support/. This site will also give you access to knowledge base articles which contain detailed step-by-step instructions for most tasks such as setting up an LUT profile or exporting an image sequence out of one program into another etc... Another great source of info about this product line is this forum. It covers many different subjects and users usually respond quickly with well explained solutions to problems they may have encountered before. For example if I search 'DaVinci Resolve 16' in this thread there were nearly 20 relevant replies within minutes of posting my original query - http://forum.bmdtech.info/index.php?board=48.0. This means there are plenty of people ready and willing to assist when needed!\nFor your specific inquiry I recommend starting off watching these two tutorial playlists (there are more but just pick whichever best suits what you want to accomplish):\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item [Color Correction Playlist](https://youtu.be/_9nRqkDjJiY) (for getting basic corrections done.)\n\\end{itemize}\n\nIts worth taking some extra time to watch both parts of the second video because it explains the basics quite well without spending too much time on other less important details so that you get familiarised with how everything works at first glance.

This folder contains previews files (`*.jpg`, *.png`) that may be used by some other application that can use such image formats but if so, there might also be an `.vrf` file too.

So we have \"Blended - 8bit (uncompressed)\" if it has blending effects applied at all (might just affect the alpha channel value of materials), then it would probably go well to call this renderer a \"Color Grading Render\". We get different choices depending on our choice here including things to do with a \"High Dynamic Range (HDR) Viewer\", \"LogC space\" \"Linear workflow\", amongst many others. Just pick the preset that corresponds with how you expect the final product looking like after editing & rendering, especially on the Hue scale because this scales between red and blue across every single object within view distance of where you point the cursor inside the Viewer window; which usually doesn't happen since it makes each item have its own unique colour scheme instead of trying to match similar colours throughout the same shot taken over time and moving forward through the timeline. However once your scenes were rendered out onto separate videos, these colors appear more distinct than their individual renders; because of their relative movement against one another during the passage of time captured on film stock medium/rec"

For that go back to \"lights & grades\" section where all different kinds of lights and grading settings will be displayed according to what is visible in frame. So let\u2019s first add fill light and then shadows to give our character some dimension and volume. Let's also play around with saturation, contrast etc.. Also look at Lumetri Color tools menu on top left side and experiment with each individual parameter individually and try out different combinations.

Make sure \"image processing\" option under filters tab is selected and hit \"playback\" button near bottom right corner so it starts playing frames one after another without pauses.

            "The following are the steps I followed to create my scene with UE4 and Blender: https://imgur.com/a/WyBxqR1 (please look at all images)  The materials were created in UE4 Material Editor and then exported into .blend files which could be used by blender for modelling and animation purposes. In addition, the texture was generated through the UE4 engine and later saved into a PNG format file so it can be imported directly from blenders asset library without having to use a UV mapping process.   When rendering the image above , the final product looked quite good but the lighting was off; it wasn\u2019t very realistic looking due to its flat appearance. I also had an issue where I wanted to change the mood and intensity of the scene based upon different parameters such as time and day cycle changes throughout the course of one single video game session.    My current setup includes two lights - a white sunlight coming down onto the grassy field from left side, and a red glowing fire ember placed next to the main character on the right hand side. However, these are static and do not have dynamic properties when applied within a particular context i.e. the changing seasons or during certain parts of the days life cycles. Therefore, if I want to simulate this effect more effectively I need to incorporate some form of post production software which allows me to apply gradients, shadows, tones etc\u2026   As stated earlier I plan on utilizing the Adobe Premiere Pro CC suite along with Davinci resolve 16 in order to achieve my desired result. For example, if I want to make the scene appear warmer or cooler, what adjustments would I need to implement? Or if I want to make the background seem more desolate, dark and cold what type of gradient masks might work best here ? I would really appreciate someone guiding me through this"

Here\u2019s what i did for you: https://imgur.com/a/X30Q74w\n\nAnswer: \\begin{itemize}\n\\item Firstly, go to \u201cEdit\u201d tab > Color Correction > Curves panel (or use keyboard shortcut Ctrl+M) . This will allow us to adjust colors in the video clip.\n<IMAGE>\n\\end{itemize}\n\n2.Then select \u201cColor Panel\u201d icon from top right corner. Select \u201cLuma\u201d tab if needed then press \u201cAuto Contrast\u201d. Afterwards, we can see the Luma channel which represents brightness values. We also have RGB channels where each one represent red, blue and green color value. To get started with our work, let\u2019s start by making sure all three luminance channels are equalized so they have the same amount of black and white pixels. In other words, it makes them balanced and neutral. So firstly click on Auto Contrastr button at the end of Luma curve. Then click and slide up the yellow point until it reaches around 96 \u2013 100%. It means the middle grey tone between darkest and lighted tones has approximately 8% more white than the dark side but less than 8% more white than the light part. Next, drag down the blue dot to -10%, because we want to increase blue saturation slightly. Finally, pull down orange dot to +5 % since we need little bit of extra contrast. The result after these simple corrections looks better now. Let's move on next step...\n<IMAGE>\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Now lets focus on Red channel and its corresponding curves. Click on \"Curves\" tab underneath Color Panel. Slide leftmost point of red line upward about half an percent and then drag down centerpoint",
            "I will give an example from my own experience here with the image below which was rendered in Unreal Engine 4 (I do believe it can also be done for other engines). I want a similar style but with more moodiness/horror vibe. The original image has a lot of light coming through windows so there isn\u2019t too much room for creative freedom unless you wanted to darken up all those areas and then bring back some highlights where they were originally before. So what I did was create an adjustment layer called \u2018Lowlight Filter\u2018 by going into Lumetri Color Effect > Low Light Filter > Adjust Levels. I used a value of -120 for the lower end and +70 for the upper end. Then once I had created this filter effect I applied it over the whole image and changed the opacity down to about 8%. This helped reduce the brightness of certain elements such as window frames and roof tiles without making everything too dull. Afterwards if needed you could always go into the shadows and increase the contrast levels to add even further depth to them. Hope this helps :)\n\nAssistant(answer):  I think this is a really nice idea! In order to achieve this, we need to first understand how to control exposure in DaVInci Resolve. There aren\u2019t specific sliders for Exposure, however, you can use Shadow/Highlight Recovery to change these parameters. To start off, let's look at our image above and see how many stops we have lost due to underexpose. Let\u2019s open the image in DaVinici resolve and select \u201cShot Details\u201d tab in the top right corner, under \u201cImage Info,\u201d scroll down until you find \u201cDynamic Range.\u201d As you can see the dynamic range is only between two stops; therefore, we can safely say this is an underexposed shot because"

Also my computer is so fast now (24GHz)!!\n\nAnswer: As discussed earlier [here](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/179360), \\em{code} is simply text written out using symbols (`*` `+` `/`, etc.). So it makes no particular logical sense when people write about \"hard\" coded software (since writing things down only involves strings of characters). The word 'code', however, can take many other forms than plain words. E.g., [French Fries contain \"chemical code\"?](http://www.snopes.com/food/ingredient/fryscanons.asp); [The meaning behind 555 - \"Pizza Code.\"](http://forum.allaboutcircuits.com/threads/pizzacodeshow.8766/)",
            "1) Coding itself will become more straightforward with improvements coming about due to open-sourcing most languages/platforms by their respective companies; 2) It gets harder for humans to create programs faster when machine learning comes into play (think deep learning/neural networks). Computers have started outperforming us at tasks where we can teach it exactly how things work; whereas, people get better results working on solving problems themselves than following existing solutions given step-by-step instructions - just like how computers take longer than doing it yourself... but they still require an active role from them because there are some exceptions even though everything mostly works through trial & error without fully understanding why it works. So then we need machines who understand every aspect around programming language execution and algorithms so that this becomes easier than teaching machines \"how\" to solve all kinda of computing tasks with code alone -- which currently doesn't exist yet except from basic AI. So this may sound counterintuitive, but having human assistance could actually be useful because you could come up with different approaches faster using less time since machines rely heavily on repetition, while creativity helps humans excel. The same approach applies to anything that involves creating something unique like building furniture or craftsmanship artwork where design skills matter over pure programming knowledge in order to achieve quality output. So basically once we build a programmable/understandably intelligent computer to replace ourselves in these areas too we would probably find ourselves in a world where there aren't many reasons left for people to exist as jobs requiring our biological presence start getting automated away until either a universal UBI system eventually kicks off and makes everyone financially independent no matter if one has a job or not, or someone decides to turn against society in response to this technically progressed social environment by taking advantage or trying to profit of its advancements by engaging in cyber attacks.

Self-attention has better expressivity than CNN/RNN because it learns the contextual dependency between elements by calculating attention matrices between query, key, value matrices for each sample independently and aggregating results afterwards - see here [for visualisation](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/issues/267#issuecomment-584901358) for details and some additional discussion around the subject.. This property also helps with understanding and modelling complex tasks like image classification, text processing etc where data might be represented as higher order tensor such as in RNN based sequence prediction approaches e.g., Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory network (\\em{BIDIM}). Self attentions allow model parameters to adjust their relative importance during training, leading to an ability to extract semantic relationships from the data at scale (highly effective in practice when dealing with millions of images in computer vision), unlike other approaches like Convolution Networks and Recurrent Neural networks, both of them can only do convolution operation locally and sequentially i.e., in batches (as they work directly upon image pixels without going into a hierarchial structure), this means these algorithms will suffer greatly from limited computational power especially in resource constrained devices since memory and computing power have similar relationship, i.e. linear, hence making the latter approach highly cost intensive in terms of energy consumption whereas attention mechanisms operate very efficiently. Also note that, we still use standard backpropagation to update the weight matrices during optimization procedure and this step can also take up lot of resources so the whole system is tuned properly in parallel, therefore",

The authors were interested in designing neural network architectures which could process complex relationships between inputs and outputs \\cite{kingma2014}. One such architecture was Transformer proposed by Vasudev et al., where they have replaced RNN based recurrent layers with a set of attention heads which learns the importance of each input at different times. It was found that self attending models can solve many NLP tasks faster than RNN/LSTM model even when used for few layers only (see Fig-\\ref{fig:att_head}). The attention mechanism makes use of dot product operations to calculate how much two vectors (or more) depend on one another, this operation requires no additional memory storage because it takes advantage of vectorized multiplication tables\\cite{vaswani2017} . Attention helps the system focus on certain features in its environment, and therefore perform better compared to traditional approaches like RNN/LSTM. As discussed earlier, in self attending models the number of parameters grows linearly but computational complexity remains constant throughout the training time due to the availability of shared weights. This feature enables efficient scaling up of models. Furthermore, it allows these models to learn long term dependencies efficiently since we do not need to maintain intermediate state during computation unlike LSTM cells. The most important characteristic of these models is that it outperforms all other competitors consistently across multiple domains without relying on huge amounts of data or hyperparameter tunning.\\par For instance, an early version of Transformers had shown improvement over BERT \\cite{devlin2018bert}, a very popular pretrained language model trained using massive amount of textual corpora in the form of WordPieces tokens(see Fig-\\ref{fig:bert}). Even though, the improvements are small",
            "Self attention helps capture long range dependencies between different tokens which helps better generalization than feeding individual inputs separately for each token like we do when using fully connected layers. This allows us to reduce number of parameters required compared to conventional approaches where all tokens are fed together but without capturing the dependencies among them. The advantage over recurrent neural networks is that it has much lesser parameter count due to skip connections which enables fast inference speeds (in terms of FLOPS) . However one drawback of this architecture is its dependence on data availability during training i.e., if there aren\u2019t enough labeled examples available then it can fail to learn well especially for high dimensional input spaces such as images/video. Hence one needs large datasets containing many examples for learning tasks involving complex input domains(eg face recognition). For lower dimension input space , it is able to achieve good results because it doesn\u2019t need huge amounts of labeled data unlike deep convolutional neural network architectures which have achieved state of art performance. One variant of transformers uses only self attending queries at beginning followed by multiple layers of self attention. These sub-quadratic versions use significantly fewer resources since they only compute the inner product of two vectors rather than the entire matrix multiplication required for full self-attention model. Also note that they may require more steps of forward propagation since we cannot perform backward pass once query and key are computed so this may slow down inference speed unless hardware support is provided through accelerators(eg tensor processing units) or GPU parallelism is exploited efficiently."

It also allows us to focus on important parts (words). 2) Sub-linear variants of Transformer were proposed by Vaswani et al., which reduce the memory requirements significantly. They can achieve similar performance compared to vanilla versions at low computational expense. However, they may have lower accuracy due to reduced capacity. 3) For example, Distributed Memory Network uses distributed attention across all heads whereas Self-Attention only attends once per head. This means that we need more parameters than DNM to obtain equivalent results since there is less redundancy between layers when using SANet over DNNNet. Also, it would be useful to see how these techniques scale with increasing sequence lengths such as NLP.\n\\end{blockquote}",
            "I am interested only in understanding how attention works for Transformer models? What would be an intuitive explanation?\n\nAssistant: The attention function takes a set of words from input sequence $X$ (or context) and produces a new vector $W_a \\in R^k$. This can also take place during training time by using stochastic gradient descent algorithm over this output vector W$_a$ where $k = d/2$, i.e., it computations a weighted average over all the tokens in the input sentence. Then we multiply these weights by word embeddings $\\mathbf{w} _i \\in R^{v}$. These multiplied vectors then go back into our model as part of the hidden states. We have two matrices which represent both directions of computation - one is for encoder side, called query matrix $Q \\subseteq X\\times V$, another for decoder side, called key matrix, k\\_matrix $\\subseteq Y \\times V$; and value matrix V$\\subseteq X\\times Z$, Z being vocabulary size; and finally attention scores $S_{qy}$ which represents dot product between q(query) and y(value). So the score will look like S[0],... , S[$|V|$] . For each row s[x], there is some probability distribution $P[y=j | x=x', s_{xy}]=\\frac{\\exp(-s_{qy})}{\\sum _{i}\\exp (-si_{qy}))}. P[y=j]. Now if the score for j is greater than zero then the token at index j gets assigned more importance compared to other tokens. And this process continues till end of the sequence. It means that every single token has its own representation. There might be cases when a token doesn't get much attention because its score becomes very low due to some bad data. That's fine but what matters is whether the"

The other two main ones are product_description (for all products) and customer-orders(for sales orders). Would there also need to be a table about the different models/styles of uavs? How would this work if they were all just stored under \"UAV\"? I have looked into what needs to be included on the website so far. There will be a homepage with info regarding types and prices of each drone available from them, along with pictures and descriptions etc.. Then when someone clicks on their specific choice it takes them through to another page showing more detailed specs of their particular chosen item e.g battery life, camera quality etc... This then leads onto the checkout process where customers can select how many items they want to purchase (there may be more than one per order), choose which payment method they wish to use, enter their delivery address details including post code, email & phone number etc... This page has some fields left blank like a billing address field however these are filled out by the system later during the process once the credit card is successfully authorized using Stripe API. It then shows the total cost of everything ordered before going back again to display shipping costs based upon weight. Once people have selected whether or not to pay for extra fast tracking services (which will vary depending on location) the final step is the checkout summary where things get sent off to PayPal for processing - after entering the relevant banking details. Is the checkout page the only place we would require unique ID numbers to identify the individual records? If so, how do we store this data within the DB structure itself? Do we create separate user IDs for every single record for each category, i.e. A1234567890 = uav1; B12345",

They also offer aftermarket modifications/upgrades on other manufacturers products, eg making a drone \"drone racing capable\". My task was just to draw up a basic DB structure, but this led into more detailed questions from my colleague about the business itself. As it stands now, he thinks we might want to implement the following data elements: - Drone Parts: Name & Description of each part - Hardware Modifications: Changes made by us to various hardware items used by different brands of UAV; these would be implemented at purchase time. e.g. adding certain features to a particular model of gimbal, to allow faster swapping between cameras / lenses. In this case we\u2019d probably store details only if the customer wanted one included. This could mean a different process to normal. - Aftermarket Upgrades: A subset of above; changes which must occur before shipping. For example, many high end FPV camera systems come pre-installed on frames using \u201cstraight\u201d cables. These will break off when the frame crashes, so our modification involves replacing straight cable connectors with \u201cY\u201d style ones \u2013 much stronger.

Natural Selection would happen over hundreds of thousands if millions of years based on environmental conditions this affects reproductive rates when the species reproduces more offspring live longer then they spread throughout the population eventually after enough generations occur changes occur where there traits become beneficial making them suited for their environment . Natural selection has been happening since life began because we need to have adaptable individuals otherwise no animals will exist like dinosaurs who did not evolve fast enough became extinct same goes today we see things get outcompeted such as certain lions or rhinos which do not reproduce often enough even though this happens quick change will take place over several million and possibly trillion year periods before becoming noticeably apparent.

In addition to this discussion regarding Metaphysics, we have talked about Epistemology as well which pertains directly to Knowledge. For more detail regarding what each means check out those previous links, and feel free to message me if anything needs further clarification :) Now back onto topic here : The way to think of Moral Values is that they stem off from the Natural Selection process of animals through generations due to the need for survival & reproductive success - meaning these traits that allowed one organism(animal)to successfully pass its genes along was advantageous compared to another who had a different set of moral values or no value system altogether, and therefore was able to live longer & produce healthier young. These types of systems where there are multiple variations amongst species over millions of years then leads towards natural selection favouring some individuals because it provides them better odds than others so long as they keep producing offspring and thus keeping themselves alive & successful in reproduction, ultimately passing their own versions down via the DNA to subsequent future generations until it eventually spreads throughout many other species like bacteria and viruses do. So although most of us are humans and look human today , the core belief systems were derived originally based upon an animal's version of Morals/Values etc... but we simply took this trait away and modified our brain chemistry & social behaviours according to modern culture nowadays such as creating"

In other cases, some tribes would eat people from neighboring villages because they believed this made them stronger than if someone else had eaten those people - so they did not view themselves doing anything wrong by murdering others and cannibalizing parts of corpses to use for medicine. So, even though these actions were deemed immoral within western society at the time, it might have seemed reasonable to members of these tribes.\n\nComment: @AliBaba I am sorry but I do not understand your point? What do you want me to say about morality and religion?\n\nAnswer: Morales evolves over generations, just like every aspect of humanity. It has no absolute meaning, nor is it meant to. There will always exist different groups who disagree with one another regarding morale issues.\nEvolution is not a process which leads towards \\em{truth}, since truth doesn't really exist outside of individual interpretations, and thus is subjective. Evolution only works towards adaptivity. Adaptivity isn\u2019t the same as \u201ctrue\u201d, although sometimes true things become more common through adaptation, especially when it comes to facts about the world around us.

A standard 3 barracks 1 bunker terran strategy starts with building three pylons and two refineries; each of these buildings require sixteen seconds of labor, and therefore four minutes and thirty one (4 mins & 31 sec) worth of construction labour before production can begin - however, only three out of eight worker slots must be active throughout this process. At most times upwards of fifty percent efficiency could result on average through a good build cycle so a rough estimate of fifteen total workers may complete a set of four bases by itself over about five days worth of time (i.e., ten minutes / unit X ~60 workers = approximately twelve full cycles, where each worker costs twenty five dollars to produce.) The second wave requires the placement of additional defenses against potential gank attempts by Zergling ground troops; namely a medivac structure for faster repairing, some zombie units, possibly zealot hives for further offensive pressure upon the enemy player\u2019s forces. Additionally, an additional expansion may be placed here as necessary.

The goal with self training would be to find some way to combine all the generated text into one single text sample from which we can extract labels at scale (this might require having a larger dataset than just what gets used by an autoencoder). In general this doesn\u2019t work well unless the task is super easy because you have no idea how much noise to discard before making decisions based on those few remaining words. This has been done somewhat successfully recently with neural machine translation, where it\u2019s enough to compare a pair of sentences and choose whichever looks more likely to come after \u201cthen\u201d given their previous sentence. For tasks like sentiment analysis however, you need far longer samples than most natural languages provide, so this becomes extremely hard even when the generation is high quality.

This binding creates an electric signal which causes these cells to release dopamine into our body.

Dopamne works like the glue that holds two objects attached together, without it the object wouldn\u2019t hold together properly so it needs to keep making new links to maintain their connection. 3) There have been studies done where scientists gave rats morphene, an opioid drug, which has similar properties to heroin.

When this happens, it causes these neuron to release more dopamine into the synapse between them. This increase in dopamine activity results in increased signaling within the neural circuitry involved in motivation and reinforcement learning. Increases in dopamine levels can also be caused by drugs such as cocaine which mimics its effects at the molecular level. Drug addiction occurs when people become dependent upon repeated exposure to substances like heroin or nicotine because they cause increases in dopamine levels. These drug induced changes in dopamine function have been linked to many psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder(ADHD), depression, bipolar disorder, Parkinson\u2019s disease, Tourette syndrome, obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and alcohol use disorder. 2) Seratonergic systems play a key role in regulating emotions and behaviors related to social interactions. Drugs that block serotonin from acting on its target sites will result in decreasing aggression and increasing prosociality. For example, SSRIs used for treating major depressive disorder act by blocking the action of monoamines like serotonin and norepinephrine at their respective transporters. Blockade of these transporter proteins prevents the recycling of these neurochemicals back into the presynaptic cell where they would otherwise be broken down.

            "1) I would use simple language (as they have probably never heard this term before). The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), is an intergovernmental organization founded by France and Germany in 1989 on the initiative of the G7 to develop policies to combat money laundering. It is located in Paris and currently has forty nine members including Canada which joined recently. They provide policy recommendations regarding combating money-laundering, financing terrorism, proliferation, etc.. They do so through three methods - regulations, recommendations, and rulings. These regulations require governments around the world to adopt certain standards to fight these threats; the recommendations encourage countries to take additional measures; and lastly the Rules of Application allow for cooperation between law enforcement agencies within different jurisdictions. A lot of work goes into developing each recommendation, such as analyzing risks posed from criminal activities, consulting with international bodies, considering economic impacts, taking legal issues into account, identifying key vulnerabilities in the financial system and many other factors. Once completed, the FAFT recommends their guidelines be followed in order to effectively protect people from criminals. In conclusion, it provides a set of rules for government institutions, private entities and individuals who want to follow best practices when dealing with anti-money laundering/combatting finance terrorism and prevention of illicit fund flows. This means ensuring banks are transparent about how they conduct business, knowing what products may be used to launder funds and having appropriate internal controls and compliance systems. For example, a bank might look at where a client gets its income, how much they earn compared to previous years, whether there is a high risk country listed, how frequently they transfer large sums internationally and other things like that.

Most people cannot hold air into their alveolar sacs fast enough to take up this extremely short lasting gas molecule; however if anyone did survive, they could have potentially lost most or all sight function due to severe damage by direct contact directly on cells of retina tissue because these specialized nerve fibers in eye are vulnerable to attack by many different poisons which may cause blindness immediately upon skin toxicant contamination, whereby even smaller molecules such as hydrogen peroxides can penetrate cell membranes just as readily causing similar problems since both organics require special transport proteins at barrier surfaces before crossing into sensitive internal components including DNA/RNA bases.

The potential risk associated with these side-effects are serious especially since symptoms typically develop after months rather than hours after acute intoxications.

            "Capoeira was first developed by Afro-Brazilian slaves who used this method for combat during slave revolts against white slave owners/overseers. Since these slaves were forbidden from carrying weapons outside their homes, they would hide knives inside hollowed out musical instruments such as tambourines and drums. When an enemy approached them too close, one member of the group (usually referred to as a \"Capo\") would stand up and flip around with the instrument hidden behind his back and stab whichever attacker he could get closest to before fleeing into the forest on foot away from other attacking groups. The technique involved quick, complex movements done simultaneously across both sides of the body which were designed to disorientate the victim so that they could be quickly subdued through physical contact. This combination of fighting style along with rhythmic music was further refined throughout its evolution until eventually becoming what we recognize today as traditional capoeira. A similar yet different version known as Angola was popularized among prisoners during slavery times but nowadays many people refer to all styles of capoeira under the same title. Overall, capoeira was created specifically as a means for self defense by enslaved Africans using various types of techniques including dancing, acrobatic moves, kicks and jumps, and weaponry such as metal rod-like batas. Many modern day capoeiristas still practice forms of combat, however due to restrictions placed upon black people after emancipation most no longer train in this way, choosing only to perform and play live shows rather than compete with eachother like they once did. Modern capoeiras also incorporated influences from dances native to Brazil at the turn of the century resulting in more fluid movement styles as well as incorporating additional percussion elements."

Since then this Afro-Brazilian culture spread throughout Brazils countryside during the transatlantic slave trade. After slavery abolition (in 1850), Capoeria grew very popular among rural afro braziliense cultures who used its fight moves on other masters in tournaments where a lot of money was wagered upon which fighter would win their match. The competition aspect of these tournaments drew hundreds if not thousands of spectators from villages near by whom came to watch their favorite fighters compete against eachother.  Eventualy some elders began teaching children the basics of fighting so they could have an advantage at such tourneymes but also develop good agility skills for everyday life(as many people did no participate actively in society nor were involved much with work). Around thiis same era \"Capoery Angola\" took place which included elements derived mostly of traditional dance , acrobatic movements performed by men exclusivly wearing women outfits which may suggest the early days of gender integration into capoorera.\nEventually (around mid 20th century ) the Afro-brazilian martial arts lost favority among most peolpe in general after Brazil became more influenced by European culture .This cultural shift lead to increased interest in MMA sports such es jiujutsu/brazilian jui jitsu along with boxing ect...

            "It is derived from Angolan Capoeria and Portuguese Dan\u00e7a-de-Casa, and later influenced by other cultures like the Caribbean (particularly Jamaica), North American culture with hip hop elements incorporated into their performances since its emergence at mid century during a period of urban migration which increased intermixing among Afrodescendant groups and between African Americans. This allowed for further experimentation, evolutionary processes within capoeir\u00edstica circles leading up until present day whereby this particular artistic movement can be described more specifically under three different branches - the modern Brazilian Regional Capoeira group known simply as 'capoeira', an afrocuban/norteafricana based branch referred to collectively as \"candombe\", also found across latin american countries, especially in Venezuela and Cuba and then there\u2019s another version practiced predominantly amongst Africans residing primarily in Senegal and Mali. This third branch includes some forms that may be seen today but only recently been rediscovered due to their relative isolation compared to mainstream Capoeira in the country; the two primary forms associated with the traditional Afrobranco roots are the Cucurite (a mix between West African & Afrolatino dances) & Kankunh (also mixed but much less popular). Both of these types are generally characterized by their musical rhythms being accompanied solely through the use of percussion instruments such as maracas & shekere, unlike regional Capoeiracg in Brazil. These traditions were introduced back into Brasil following World War II via various slave routes when enslavers began selling them on markets after abolitionism took effect in most South America colonies except in Argentina which never adopted this type of institution. This practice continued until approximately early half of twentieth Century so there was a relatively short amount of time in terms of human development in",
            "It originated during the slave trade between Africa, America & Europe with its origins rooted within Angola\u2019s Afro-Brazilian communities, but there was also some influence from European traditions (Fencing) incorporating different elements into this style. As we all can imagine Capoeira came about for survival reasons \u2013 people had to protect themselves by disguising their attacks with rhythmic acrobatic moves; these techniques allowed slaves to avoid capture.\nCapoeiristas used their music instruments to attract enemies and then when they got close enough use one swift attack and disappear quickly back through an elaborate routine which consisted mainly on flips and turns making it very hard to predict where the enemy will strike next, this is known today as the 'Circle game'. Over the years it has developed from purely a combatant art into what it now is today, although Capoiera is still considered primarily as such many modern practitioners focus more so on performance and showcasing various tricks whilst using roda/circles(as seen here), these rods usually have 12 players, including a \u2018rodopreta'(one who initiates songs throughout practice sessions); they consistently sing choros accompanied by instruments such as tambourine drums and guitars to encourage energy amongst each other, as well as improving memory retention, flexibility, endurance, etc\u2026 In conclusion Capoeiras purpose hasn't changed too much however I would say the emphasis of learning new moves & combinations, creating sequences & getting involved with local tournaments & performances may take priority rather than fighting due to modern society values changing along side with advancing technology, which allows us access to information without needing direct contact anymore like it once did...

            "Capoeira was developed by enslaved Africans who lived on sugar plantations throughout colonial Brazil during the early sixteenth century. It combines elements from various African traditions such as Angola-Kikongo and Ndumbi, with some European influences. During slavery, Afro Brazilians were often discriminated against and had limited access to education, so they passed down knowledge through verbal story telling methods (folklore) rather than written records. As this knowledge could be used for survival, there became an urgency among the slaves to pass these stories onto their children. These legends were later revised into books after the abolition of slave trade and served as primary sources for historians and anthropologists.\n\n### Initiation and promotion process\n\nThere is no set format regarding when someone can initiate another person within AMA, however there must always be a valid reason for doing so; for example if two users have been conversing about topics relevant to one another for a long period of time.

            "It was developed by slaves during colonial times (16th century) in Rio de Janeiro who had little access to weapons due to slave status but wanted self-defense skills against their oppressors. They would fight each other on top of large piles of sand to practice this technique which came from African martial arts brought to South America through slavery. It eventually became recognized legally for its physical health benefits rather than being banned like many traditional sports were at the time because of political reasons such as soccer which took place after work hours where workers could have social interactions with peers without management present. It has become popular today around the world for those interested in exercise, performance and/or combat sport, although it can be controversial among some groups who view it negatively given historical contexts of slavery in countries like the United States. The word \"capoeira\" itself comes from the Tupi language meaning \u201cfight\u201d and also means \u201cwarrior.\u201d The main moves of Capoeira come from fighting techniques used when there was no room left between fighters. Capoeiristas will try to attack an opponents\u2019 back side so they cannot block properly; they might use one hand to defend themselves from another while simultaneously using the same hand to kick their enemy in the stomach or ribcage. The style emphasizes kicks more than most martial arts since people were not allowed to carry blades and therefore needed different methods to inflict damage upon enemies. Capoeiras do incorporate elements of acrobatics into their performances which may appear to the casual observer to resemble break dancing, however the movements serve much more functional purposes. There are several regional styles including AfroBrazilian, Angola, Regional Baiano, Sao Paulo, etc.\n\\end{code}"

            "The origin of capoiera dates back from the beginning of the 18th century when slaves were brought into brazil by Portuguese settlers during colonization. Capoeira began as an escape route used by these enslaves to fight against their masters who wanted them under control at all costs. It was developed by runaway slaves living around Rio de jeneiro where they would train each other secretly for self- defense using different moves such kicking, punches etc. This made it difficult foe people to identify what this sport really meant because it looked like dancing but had fighting techniques hidden behind its disguise. In 1609 slavery ended so capoeirra became less popular since there weren\u2019t many blacks left in rio de Janeiro which was the center for the game. After the end of slavery some slave descendants started to practice again and also introduced new movements. By the early twentieth century, however, capoeira became increasingly stigmatized within white society; thus it spread mainly among the Afro-Brazilian community throughout the northeast and southeast regions of Brazil.\n\nCommentary: The above response provides good historical background on the origins, evolution and culture surrounding the Brazilian tradition of Capoeira. The response could use more examples to support the argument.\nThe response could be expanded upon by adding information about the impact of capoeiras on Brazils economy (i.e. tourism).\nAlso add additional details regarding the role of women practitioners of Capoeira, and how Capoeira helped with the social acceptance of African Americans.",
            "Capoeira originated from Africa around 1500AD. The first Africans came into contact with Portuguese sailors during their slave trade voyages. These slaves were taken onboard ships by Portuguese merchants who traded them for sugar cane at ports along the coast of Angola and Mozambique, among other countries. In order to survive this journey they had to learn to fight amongst themselves so as not to be eaten alive! They also learned new ways of living which included playing games like soccer (football) and dancing. When these enslaves reached Brazil they started practicing fighting moves and created what we now call \"Capoeira\". As years progressed people began teaching others about capoeira because they knew if someone was good enough they would get better food rations etc... Soon after, many different styles developed due to the different African tribes brought here. Nowadays there have been more modern influences such as music and acrobatics. It is still practiced today but only by few groups.\n\nAnswer by: Assitant\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Capoiera originates from the country called Brasil. Its roots date back to 8th century when the Portugese landlords captured the black people and made them work in farms. To escape the hard labour conditions, they used to practice some secret forms of combat. This helped then avoid punishment given out for rebellion and disobeyence. The name \u201cCapoiero\u201d literally means \u201cone against one\u201d, referring to the two sides involved in each encounter \u2013 master vs pupil or even opponents.\n\\end{itemize}"

In general if we have small number of features with high cardinality, then we can go for xgboost because it has better support for sparse inputs (such as categorical features). If our input dimension > 50K (or more), lightgbom would be preferred. For intermediate cases such as large features and low cardinality, catboost may be optimal choice but it requires custom tuning for each feature set. The best option will depend upon how many categories there are, shape of the distribution etc., so recommendations might change from time-to-time. This article compares them http://www.deeplearning4j.org/xgboost-vs-lightgbm. Note that these libraries also come bundled with their own implementations of gradient boosted decision trees - XGBTree vs LGDTree. Here again, there are differences depending upon whether they are single node estimators or distributed learners. 2) Since xgboost can optimize both tree and ensemble models using parallelization techniques internally, it generally performs much faster than other libraries like lightgbm and catboost when used correctly. 3) Depends on specific application needs.. Xgboost is mostly used for regression problems whereas lightgbm is mainly used for classification applications.. For example, Xgboost may perform better for recommendation systems where we need predictive power, but since the underlying dataset is quite small (with few samples per class) compared to the total size, the computation cost could still exceed the accuracy gain obtained by increasing #trees in xgboost..",

            "XGBoost - This model was created by Microsoft researchers. It works on CPUs and GPUs and it uses random forests with tree depth limit.\nLightGBM - this model is from Google AI team and works well when training time is critical but computation power can be increased later. In such cases, lightgbm provides good results compared to other algorithms. It has lower memory requirement than xgb boosting. But if there is sufficient computing power then using lighter version would have been better because of less number of passes required over data. So if time permits, we prefer xgboost models rather than lightgbm models. However, since our current task doesn\u2019t require high performance and processing speed so we choose LighGbM Model\nCatboost- It also comes under XGBoost family (lightgbm). Its advantage is that it learns more complex features and thus improves accuracy significantly compared to normal light gbm model. It makes decision trees using different learning algorithm called CART (Classification And Regression Trees) Algorithm. As it performs many passes over the dataset so it consumes higher computational resources and hence needs huge RAM size to store all these intermediate calculations and predictions . The drawback here is that once trained, it becomes difficult to retrain without changing the whole structure. We found catbooster having the best prediction rate among the three models used in the competition. Thus, according to us , cat boaster gives highest probability score among others and will predict most accurate output for the given input data.",
            "1)XGboost uses random forests to create decision trees using an ensemble approach where multiple models are created at once from training data (which is also known as boosting). This is different than other machine learning algorithms such as SVMs/logistic regression etc., since these do not require multiple predictions like Boosted Trees. For instance, when predicting the probability of having heart disease given age & gender, it may be easier to build separate trees based on each feature alone. In this case, Random Forest can provide better accuracy by creating several trees. It\u2019s similar to building multiple logistic regressions, but much more efficient due to the tree-based algorithm. 2)LightGBM has the same architecture as GBM but with fewer hyperparameters so you can tune it faster without compromising too many details about the model itself. Since we are interested in fast prototyping here, it would be wise to go ahead and choose LightGBM if time constraints apply. The tradeoff however is less flexibility regarding tunable parameters compared to GammaBolt, although still very flexible nonetheless. So it all depends really. I prefer GammaBot myself because of its greater customizability though! Hope that helps. Good luck :)"

For example , lets assume if I have cost_function=mean squared error + logistic regression then during the training process I will first apply MSE and get its corresponding predictions using Logistic Regression. Then based upon those predictions again calculate mean square error. Now this procedure keeps happening until we hit some criteria e.g max number of iteration reached or convergence achieved etc..\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\strong{\\strong{'`xgb-tree`'}} : This algorithm doesn\u2019t follow SGD approach rather tree induction methodology used by traditional decision trees.

            "XGBoost is an ensemble learning method with a boosting algorithm at its core. It was first released by Google researchers for academic purposes but now it has become widely used in industry. LightGBN is a lightweight version of GBT, designed specifically on mobile devices like phones. Cat Boost can be seen as a combination of random forest (decision trees) and deep learning techniques (neural networks). The decision tree learns from past experience and neural network learns from recent data. Both algorithms learn faster than traditional machine leaning models such as SVMs etc., however they do so at some cost; their performance decreases when there is noise in data. They have been developed recently and hence lack extensive empirical results compared with other methods mentioned above. However, these algorithms work extremely well under certain circumstances and therefore I recommend them."

            "I have used both for web development but never done anything serious with go so I can't really say if rust will suit my purpose more than it did for me personally..\nI like how rust makes memory management explicit by making you allocate and release everything explicitly. This way when you use it correctly you get good memory safety. It also has great concurrency features which allow you to create concurrent servers easily without having much knowledge of threading concepts.\nGo on the other hand uses a garbage collected environment and doesn't force you into allocating objects manually unlike what happens in c++ where we need to remember every single pointer allocation/deallocation and then free them at some point. Also there are no threads in golang, only goroutines(lightweight coroutine). The downside here though is that they do not work well together because one needs synchronization to avoid race conditions between different gorutines. In order to achieve this you either write locks yourself (which is very tedious) or rely on the package \"sync\" which provides lock primitives that require a lot of boilerplate code to implement. There are many things about go that i find quite annoying such as its lack of proper support for unicode strings(you always have to encode them first before sending), and it's somewhat verbose syntax compared to python etc. However, all these minor issues aside I still prefer using golang over most modern high level languages simply due to performance. For example, I wrote some benchmark tests comparing golang vs java vs kotlin(kotlin was actually surprisingly close in terms of runtime performance!) running some common operations on a large dataset (10M lines). The results showed up to 4X speedup in Golang compared to Java!\nSo yeah overall I feel that go fits best in situations where you have lots of small requests coming from multiple clients(easy parallelism via goroutins), or if you plan on"

The way society views male intimates changes over time too- nowadays you often see many men modelling clothing from brands such as Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Dolce & Gabbana whilst back in the day these were mainly worn only by gay individuals; so maybe this is changing our perception about gender roles; 3) They probably believe it is demeaning to put yourself into feminine shoes; however, in reality, both genders need confidence boosters and it gives us a chance to be different everyday; also, if women wore boxers, surely we wouldn\u2019t mind seeing another guy in those shorties!\n",

Anyway, they must fit well around one's body and make me feel warm when worn over the clothes. Otherwise I won\u2019t use my pair or set after washing either unless I get a new one next time I go shopping because cleaning isn\u2019t fun. Other factors such as price, design quality, colour selection and material properties may play into consideration. There aren\u2019t many colours available online but most offer the option to buy separate pieces which makes the buying decision easier especially if I already know what color I really need and want. Sometimes it works better to look first where there're lots options offered but then take your personal favorite afterwards and purchase it locally or through another online shop. Many things cost less abroad whereas others are cheaper in Germany \u2013 sometimes even if paid using Paypal currency converter. They call it a saving benefit although not directly due to exchange rates but indirectly influenced by taxes and import duties. However, shipping costs tend to offset these benefits anyway... But anyway no matter how expensive goods might become, nothing compares with having purchased cheap quality goods just bought recently",
            "It can be seen more as an attempt by most companies who produce such fashion products to attract customers based upon social standards created by society over time about what \u201cbeauty\u201d is (with mostly females associated with beauty) as well as appealing to the male sex drive which requires stimulation from sexual images whether these happen internally within his own head/imagination...   (more detailed response) ...as well as there exists no real \u201cpreference\u201d among males regarding their attraction to wearing lingerie. In some countries however, there actually exist clothing lines and websites designed only specifically for male underwear, thus proving one has preferences when we\u2019re talking about just men\u2019s apparel..   The same applies to female lingerie vs feminine undergarments; they may also carry the same connotation for both gender gaps if used loosely because often times they become the \u201cdefault\u201d term we use when referring to any undergarment regardless of its material used etc. Hence it becomes almost meaningless in terms of distinction between them nowadays though it was important during Victorian era.... Thereby, I find it surprising many users did not see it coming and were not aware at all about this difference before posting! ..  To conclude, I think I have answered pretty much everything here so far :) Good luck! -1763-"

            "There seems no good reason except for the status-seeking function that makes them buy more than they need; also it gives the man the power (control) over what she wears underneath her clothes...it becomes part of her personality ... so the more he likes it -the more it controls him and she controls him... it may become his fantasy ....she knows this too.....I am guessing there isn't an explanation beyond that... it can be said however.... that it would look ridiculous if everyone was wearing \"underwear\"...therefore its best to leave out these types of garments from daily use ..unless its used just as fashion items/for special occasions etc...this applies mostly when both genders wear them though I have seen women with skirts/shorts on underneath their dress..its weird really... I guess society needs people to express different identities...some are better looking at some point of view and some less attractive but all have a role within society regardless which identity someone has. So its nice that there is space available where individuals feel free to experiment around and see what suites each other and helps find the balance needed to achieve mutual happiness :) It depends very much who asks whom questions and the kindness one wants to give away....... I am assuming most relationships today consist only between partners because there might not even be such a thing as 'couple', i think most humans tend towards polyamory due to lack of understanding of sexuality. Polyamoury comes natural for many humans but society doesnt understand that...society says love = relationship...that implies a pair....if one doesn\u2019t get it right the first time, second chances come naturally until ones learns how to love another without wanting ownership . In reality every single person in existence lives polygamy and is monogamous depending upon what circumstances lead to...i.e children and responsibilities etc",

I personally love lingerie because its more feminine & shows the shape underneath. However I prefer not to have others (particularly guys) knowing exactly which outfit i\u2019m wearing. Someone once commented on me looking pretty hot after my shower & thought there was no need for anything over the top.... But i've gotta admit im one helluva sucker when its warm outside :p"

            "2021-04-08T06:57:39Z: This may be an offensive answer so I apologize beforehand! There is nothing wrong with wearing what makes us feel comfortable - regardless if it\u2019s skimpy panties under jeans (a man) or thigh high stockings/lingerie. Some people have a fetish towards certain types of clothing; whether it\u2019s lacy items or tight fitting pieces such as leather jackets, boots etc., which some would call \u201csexy\u201d. But these clothes aren\u2019t only worn by one gender or another. They can also vary depending on culture and region \u2013 i.e. France has its own unique style of dressing. For example, in India many females prefer more traditional outfits such as saris, salwar kameezes and churidars compared to short shirts, jean cutoffs, miniskirted etc.. But that doesn\u2019t mean they are less fashionable than others who choose otherwise! And again, there is no shame in liking or disliking certain styles or garments based upon personal preference and taste. I personally find tights/leggins, biker shorts & sports bras extremely attractive! Not all males agree though ;) . As far as history goes\u2026 well back when I was in school we learned about how men used to dress up during ancient times; where as women had long robes and wore heels and veils to cover their heads, male royals were very flamboyantly dressed, sporting lots of jewelry and extravagance! The reason behind this was because the men needed protection from enemies, especially during battles and wars since most didn\u2019t fight naked!! Lol, even today some armors consist of heavy metal plates attached onto body parts! It was also thought at that time that",
            "Men tend to prefer sexual attraction from others when they have less of an opportunity to experience such feelings personally because they lack the resources to express their desire through dressing up, makeup etc.. When a man can dress however he wants at all times, he loses his need for attractiveness in order to gain sexual attention which leads him away from seeking out relationships with people who aren\u2019t already interested in him due to his own physical appearance. As more and more male actors/musicians start wearing skirts & shorts/shaving body hair/dressing feminine; more males become comfortable enough in doing so without having to feel self-conscious about it since they see other males (celebrities) get away with it just fine! Soon society will accept this as normal fashion and it won\u2019t be viewed negatively anymore - even by those who used to find it strange. I hope this helped! :)"

Men haven been told what to wear from birth, so there isn\u2019t quite the same pressure when it comes to fashion choices. They can experiment more with style without feeling judged by others.

            "The idea behind wearing lingeries was introduced by Christian Dior in his collection during World War II (Dorling Kindersley Publishing Staff). It was an attempt to revive the fashion industry after war. He created lacy bras and corsets which were made from silk stockings and parachute fabrics. After WW2 ended, people started wearing these garments because they had no money left to purchase new clothes and also because of the shortages due to rationing. This led them to buy second-hand underwear such as nightdresses etc., so there came into use the word \\em{lingerie} meaning \u201csecond-hand clothing.\u201d In 1950s the concept of \"lingery\" became popular when brands such Chanel, Balenciaga, Givenchy, Yves Saint Laurent, Jean Paul Gaultier, Vivienne Westwood began designing and manufacturing their own versions of the same (Burrows & Garnett, p437) . Since then, Lingeries have become part of every woman\u2019s wardrobe, especially since it gives a boost up her self confidence level and increases her feminine appeal (Hartman et al.). Men can nowadays wear similar types of undergarment too; however its usage is restricted only among certain sections of society. For example, some gay communities prefer wearing female underclothes than male ones, even if it means dressing up like a girl (Susan Stryker, pp68\u2013111 ).\n\n\\strong{Note}: I am not able to add images here hence I would be grateful, if someone could edit my response according to MSE standards.

Also when the discussion is taken into account, then surely even though the Indian people might be having good command upon the internet but when it comes to communication skills then probably none of them could match the level of western countries because of their proper education system as well as they had enough time and resources to master those skills during study hours , so in short I guess just because someone doesn't understand or speak anything except basic questions like \"where is the hospital\" type questions which means if we take into consideration that language barrier factor along side that then yes I feel that the west will always stand ahead ! But the other reason behind is their lifestyle choices ! Since long most people in US are already habitualized towards living alone rather spending quality times with family hence it obviously affects the way people express themselves through socializing, talking etc! So in summary after taking all these aspects into considerations we cannot deny the fact that Indians need more"

However, she accepts all other requests without checking whether they are related to ML. She works faster since there is less back-and-forth involved. This allows us to reduce costs because more work gets completed each hour (which leads to higher earnings). In practice, however, these cost savings might be offset due to longer wait times. It turns out that most users prefer fast service rather than low prices, especially when price competition between different companies exists. As soon as the number of competitors increases, even the smallest difference becomes significant and users switch to the company offering quickest delivery time. This also applies to the waiting queue which affects overall user experience negatively. Hence, the best approach seems to offer both quality and speed \u2013 a winning combination! We tested how such hybrid systems perform under realistic conditions using the OpenAI GPT\u20133 model [6]. We ran a crowdsourcing task where we asked participants to transcribe conversations recorded during interviews about machine learning topics. Our results show that a single model combining both experts into one system was able to complete tasks twice as quickly compared to a single specialized model. Also, a dual system had fewer errors compared to models that focused solely on either ML or QA tasks. While this setup performs well in our experimental setting, there may still"

            "1) A graph has vertices (nodes), edges (links between nodes). In general this could be anything from roads on a map, friends in social networks, links in Google Maps etc.\n2) The goal here is to find shortest path between two points/vertices/nodes in the graph with all constraints taken into account. This usually means we have some type of cost associated with each edge. For instance if one takes a route through Manhattan then driving across bridges will cause congestion which leads to higher costs than taking routes where there aren\u2019t any bridges.\n3) Dijkstras algorithm finds for each vertex V a distance d(V) = min_d(S,U) subject to U \u2264 S such that w(e) + u - v < k. Where e denotes an Edge and we have assumed there isn\u2019t self-loops \u2013 meaning every node connects to itself only once!\n4) Here \u201cu\u201d is another vertex in our graph, and \u201cv\u201d is either equal to u or equals to some other target vertex T. We define these two variables as the source and destination vertex respectively.\n5) There also exists no cycles in our graph so this implies that when traveling along paths starting at point V (or ending in V) and heading towards Point T it must end up back again in Vertex V after reaching its desired destination. Note though that the entire journey doesn\u2019t necessarily need to happen directly via V. It might take several intermediate steps before getting there but overall it needs to reach it eventually without doing any detours. So effectively what this really means is that given any pair of Vertices V and W (where both are different from T), we want to compute the minimum total cost needed to go from V to W by visiting first all neighbors of V until finally arriving at some neighbor W and hence finding the actual total cost cwrw=min["

Therefore, we have a shortest path for each vertex, likewise following a depth-first search all the shortest paths will be found and printed out on screen along with their corresponding sources which was initial destination. This can be verified further [here](https://gyazo.com/cbaeaabdacbdaa2afebbccebfddcfad). Hence DSJ will produce output of {(34,9),(3,2)}, because both these vertices have equal distance from ({64,0},3) and so on..

            "1) Consider a graph consisting of nodes with integer weights (the weight for each node represents its distance from start). We want to find shortest route between all pair of nodes starting at vertex 'A'. The input file contains the list of pairs of vertices A->B such that AB=<x> and also their corresponding distances d_AB.\nThe output will contain the minimum total distance required to traverse the entire network along the given edges in ascending order. Note here we do not need the exact path but only the minimum total distance required.\n2) Given below are two examples of graphs which satisfy the above requirements. For both graphs print out the minimum number of units needed to travel through them.\nExample #1 \u2013 Input : 5 6 4 3 7 9 8 0\nOutput: 12\nExplanation \u2013 The first edge goes directly from \u2018a\u2019 to \u2018b\u2019 followed by going back on itself once. Then again go forward until reaching \u2018d\u2019 where there would have been no more steps taken so far since the next step has already happened earlier when coming back from point \u2018c\u2019. This gives us 5+3 = 8 units needed. Since this was our last stop we now add one extra unit for returning back home. Thus the final value is 9 units (8 for the walk + 1 for return trip). So overall we had 10 trips made during the process.\nExample #2\u2013Input : 300 100 150 400 550 350\nOutput: 500\nExplanation - Here we take a single hop straight ahead towards point 350 then another hop straight away till we get to point 550 then finally we turn around to come back to point 350 thus making 5 hops altogether.\n\\end{code}\n\n",

So if the element is present in some row then store its index number into B else skip it. It may contain multiple entries. Note-B is sorted according to their respective indices so we can use binary search technique to locate them efficiently. Also, since it contains multiple indexes, hence we need an additional array C [] containing count no. of times they occur.\nC[i]=0 ;for all i= 0 ... N - M +1\nFor loop runs till B size equals A Size . In case B is empty means all edges were found already.

They may enjoy something based on real world history, but has supernatural elements involved . This would fit both of these genres well without necessarily being set within the time period when magic exists , and still have an interesting plotline and story arc to follow . So for example they might appreciate Neil Gaiman's `Neverwhere` Book or film adaption by Len Wiseman (Director of Sleepy Hollow ) or perhaps something involving alchemy (magic potions etc).

That is, someone asking whether their computer works has fewer than two people compared to a couple discussing books over lunch. Then decide which part of speech these things belong to \u2014 nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc., so that different parts of sentences can be matched against them differently.\n\\item Match each person in an entity set up with other people based upon similarities between those words used within sentences containing those persons, i.e., \u201cthe librarians have been doing a great job helping us find interesting new authors.\u201d This isn\u2019t easy because most models are designed for single words rather than entire sentences, so a lot of extra work needs to happen here before training starts. Also, it seems unlikely that matching two words found across sentences would ever give high enough confidence scores for useable results without significant preprocessing",

I am curious about what happened during the time since then when no updates were given regarding him in the news. The last article published online is dated February 5 2021; it appears there may be more recent articles but they do not appear publicly available at present.\n\nAnswer: So according to [this report from January](https://time.com/5786836/john-mcaffe-missing/), John had gone missing after he left his hotel room in Barcelona, presumably leaving with some kind of doctor who told him she would arrange a flight back home via Madrid. He made several calls to her and friends before disappearing and hasn\u2019t returned despite repeated requests from them over social media channels like Twitter.\nI believe police became aware of his situation soon afterwards based upon various reports submitted anonymously using their official channels. No one knows if John even contacted them directly himself either so we cannot say whether he ever intended to reach out to law enforcement first. They must have seen enough evidence though to request a warrant through Interpol which allowed them to detain anyone carrying documents linked to John McAfee including his passports.\nAt least two different passports have now been reported stolen from John along with other personal items such as computers and bank cards.\nThis whole episode has led me personally to take steps towards having my own documents scanned electronically onto secure cloud storage services just in case anything happens to me or mine again.

During February \u201920, it was discovered that he was living under an alias without registering with immigration laws of foreign country. Later that month whilst trying to leave via Panam\u00e1, a raid conducted by Belizen security forces saw one suspect murdered, another wounded severely in addition to arresting McAffee & later deporting them back to Belize once medical attention had been given.. They proceeded to accuse the McAffees of money laundering due to multiple large amounts of cash found hidden within household items.

His wife said this in an interview with CBS News on Feburary 6th of 2023 \"John passed away peacefully at home surrounded by loved ones.\" I also found this article from January 3rd stating how it was reported that doctors believe his death came as result of multiple illnesses which led up to cardiac arrest - https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/31/john-mcafee-dead-computing-pioneer . Also according to The New York Times there were no signs of foul play during his autopsy. He had some serious health problems beforehand so perhaps it would be difficult for them to find anything suspicious about him passing now.. This may take longer than usual though since we're talking about Spain here :) They could possibly need more time to process all of their paperwork regarding the cause of death if nothing else seems off when doing their investigation into the case. I hope my response helps! Good luck!!"

            "The main challenge in solving SfM problems with ROS-related libraries is their accuracy, because these solutions can have large errors depending on various factors like image quality, lighting conditions, calibration and many more (https://wiki.ros.org/RobotSensing). It depends very much how accurate one needs the final solution, which kind of data will be used for mapping(eg., stereo vision, LiDAR etc), and how many features there will be per pixel etc. But even when we have solved this issues it remains important how reliable the data collected by our sensor systems really are and whether they could affect our map construction. Therefore we always use redundant sensors whenever we work with a system which produces an estimate using just a single type of measurement (for example monocular camera or LiDAR only). So we prefer using two different kinds of measurements, such as both visual input via camera as well as distance values coming out of range finders ect... Another big topic in computer vision algorithms regarding mapping tasks has gotten some popularity lately, and is known as Monocular Vision Navigation . Here a single static point is fixed in a given scene so we have access to the geometry between each point pair but without the possibility of acquiring any new depth estimates after fixing up a particular pose during the estimation phase (see [link]). We still do get access to a good initial pose through eg. stereovision cameras but the limitation is due to no further improvements of poses over time, if all the images taken during tracking stay in same location then everything stays where its suppose to remain.. I hope i answered what you asked?",
            "2D/3D mapping for visual navigation systems; calibration with respect to environment, cameras used, lens distortion correction (lateral, barrel). The data collection stage may involve different algorithms, but mostly they need to be consistent enough to give an overall view on what was observed and measured during one pass by camera through scene, how this changes when the scene changes over time. Also some methods for registration, where one point has a unique id assigned it, and others do too. It could use the camera itself (which moves), its pose (location, rotation) at the beginning, endpoints between the two locations and the measurements themselves, if the user chooses such an option, otherwise they will have to measure all points using external reference points in their field-of-view and calculate everything manually, which takes quite long sometimes even when the accuracy doesn\u2019t matter much - this way, you get very high quality images (pixelwise resolution ~0.5cm^2); there would be multiple ways of doing this step also (the most important part here!), but they would all take care of finding keyframes throughout image series. The rest comes next - reconstruction. In essence you start from known 2d location (image coordinate space), project each line into a new world coodinate system based on its 2d projections along all other lines seen within a frame and find best fit based on reprojection errors; the final output will still look like 3 dimensional objects due to depth sensors etc., just represented mathematically (this step involves triangulation algorithms again)\n\nComment: Welcome to Academia Stack Exchange.

            "The hardest part would be to determine what to focus on during image processing since there will be multiple features with different importance. A simple way I can think of it right now is by comparing each pixel to its surrounding pixels so we could find out which one has the highest difference (if any) and then select only those for further analysis/processing. But this process requires much time. Also, it is important to choose an appropriate camera resolution and number of images to use for processing if using stereo cameras because the amount of data involved is directly proportional to them. This may take up too many resources but might be necessary when dealing with high precision problems such as medical imaging applications etc... However, another alternative method to overcome these limitations involves utilizing other techniques like machine learning methods to classify and group objects according to their shapes/textures rather than focusing solely on color information which was traditionally used beforehand. It is also good practice to always check the quality of results at every stage especially when doing iterative algorithms involving several stages to minimize errors accumulated over iterations."

            "3D point cloud data obtained by laser scanners has been shown to be an effective source for structure reconstruction \\cite{maturana_structure}. In particular, structure-from-motion (SFM) methods have proven very popular among many research groups due to the ease of implementation with off-the shelf hardware such as drones. The basic SFM approach involves capturing multiple images using either stereo rigs or RGB cameras onboard a UAV/drone and computing a dense correspondence field between them. Then, this field can be used to reconstruct the scene geometry through solving an optimization formulated as a least squares problem.\nIn practice though, there are two major problems which need to be solved first before we get to use these algorithms. Firstly, it requires some sort of calibration method to compute a homograph for each camera pair; Secondarily, it needs robust image matching technique(s) to solve for the sparse correspondence matrix $\\mathbf{C}$. This latter issue is usually tackled via global feature matching techniques like Harris corner detection\\cite{harris1987robust}, SIFT features\\cite{lowe2004distinctive} etc. However, all these approaches suffer heavily under occlusion issues since they rely on local geometric invariants to match corresponding points across views. Thus, when one of the cameras is obscured by another object, the resulting sparse matches become invalidated. To overcome this limitation, several other methods have also been proposed recently which try to address similar challenges but at different levels of abstraction. For instance, \\emph{Deep Structure From Motion (DSFMO)} algorithm uses deep neural networks to learn a mapping directly from input image pairs towards a dense correspondence field without explicit feature detection\\footnote{\\label{fn1}\\url{https://github.com/davidforsay/deep",
            "1) the most difficulty part would be to identify the points which have been captured by cameras for further use. This requires some sort of image processing algorithm like Hough transformation. But there can be many difficulties involved with this method too such as finding the best threshold values etc., so it may require trial-error methods. Also, the images might get corrupted due to various reasons (like lighting issues). So, we need a robust technique to find these points without losing them during data acquisition.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nAnswer: \\strong{\\em{\"So,\"}} indicates a continuation of what has just previously occurred - in other words, the sentence continues where it left off before.

We do this by solving a set of equations involving the camera poses and the relative distances between them. 3) Finally, once we have solved for the relative rotations and translations between the cameras, we use those values along with the camera poses to solve for the absolute position and rotation of every point on the scene.\n\\end{blockquote}"

This makes us have less data on which our AI can learn from. We need faster computers that will allow us to run algorithms with much higher speed - otherwise AI will remain only a theory until when we get those machines ready. Moreover, there is still no machine learning algorithm that has been created successfully by humans themselves so far. It always seems like every algorithm was first \"created\" by an intelligently evolved AI itself.\n2) Also, there might be another problem related to human-like consciousness which cannot be solved yet but at least it needs to be addressed somehow. So far none of the deep learning algorithms learned to recognize its own existence - they simply behave randomly sometimes, like in Deepmind game against AlphaGo Go master Lee Sedol who defeated Alphago recently. But this random behavior comes very close to what a real human mind does during playing games such as pokemon go...\n3) And lastly, the biggest challenge nowadays may become regulation. There are many people who are afraid of getting their jobs replaced because of AI technologies coming into place. Some countries already banned robotics in manufacturing sector due to fears about mass unemployment in future. But there is also an argument saying that robots create new kind of jobs where people would work alongside with automated systems.

However this can create a problem if we do not want them to experience certain negative events or actions during training since it could result in flawed behavior once put into use by humans who depend on AI to perform their jobs effectively. How will companies work around such situations when developing AIs for real world applications like self-driving cars? And what happens when someone intentionally trains an algorithm with biases against race, gender etc.. and then allows it to spread through society where it may cause problems among different communities? For example; would an African American woman have more trouble getting a loan than an Asian man even though she has better credit score due to historical reasons? Also there is always the concern about security breaches related to personal data collected by AIs which might lead to blackmail threats or other crimes. As technology advances so fast, at times, I feel AI algorithms cannot keep up with human ethics because the former is only programmed based upon existing laws whereas the latter evolves over time based on new concepts developed within our civilization.

Some other fields such as robotics have also benefited from this kind of advancements, leading to creation of autonomous vehicles, robots performing surgeries etc., all made possible because of ML algorithms helping them perceiving surroundings better than humans do through visual processing and computer vision techniques. In terms of future goals of the industry, there\u2019s been talk about general Artificial Intelligence (AI) which would mean having computers think like we do and even mimic our emotions too but at present they just replicate basic logical functions similar to what a child learns when growing up i.e. using patterns based approach rather than intuition or feelings. I hope that someday we will reach the stage where we can truly communicate with machines the way we interact with each other and maybe then, machines may actually start developing feelings too! \\n\\nAnother major challenge facing industries dealing with AI systems right now is lack of trust between customers who are worried about losing jobs to intelligent bots, however if it could lead to increased productivity, lower cost, faster decision-making & less error rate then most business leaders wouldn\u2019t mind giving away their roles to bots so long as those tasks remain within company boundaries.\\n\\nTo sum things up, currently companies need to keep an eye out on potential privacy breaches especially around personal details related to consumers. This could potentially impact sales figures adversely. On another note, if you are thinking of becoming a professional AI developer, its good idea to stay updated regarding latest trends in tech",
            "I am really curious about AI, but i do no have enough knowledge on it so this question was difficult for me! However i tried my best! Hope you like what i wrote down here!\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\nAI has become more popular recently because its capabilities have increased exponentially. This includes deep learning, neural networks etc which all involve different methods used by machines to perform tasks normally done by humans. In terms of problems with Artificial Intelligence there can be ethics involved if people are able to control machines directly via remote connection using voice commands etc (such as Amazon Echo). It also poses a problem when we give them access to sensitive data such as our medical records/financial information due to their potential to use it maliciously against us.\nThe only way around both these issues would require regulation however currently it isn\u2019t implemented into law meaning many companies get away with breaking privacy laws.\nTo counteract these problems various forms of AI must work together; Machine Learning systems, Natural Language Processing algorithms and computer vision technologies to improve performance of other machine based software applications. This could be used in combination with virtual assistants who provide real-time customer service for example, making recommendations for customers and taking orders without human interaction. Thereby reducing costs for business owners. These same technological advancements allow users to gain access to information quicker than ever before therefore providing better support services at an affordable price. Another major challenge faced within this industry is that AIs will always learn from previous experiences allowing them to develop faster and becoming increasingly sophisticated each day.\n\\end{blockquote}"

            "1) There have been multiple cases where AI has gone rogue. For instance, when an autonomous car was hacked by a hacker who used it to crash into several other vehicles, killing people inside those cars. Another example includes a chatbot on Facebook Messenger which started sending messages containing hate speech. This resulted from the bot learning bad language through its interactions with humans. These incidents show that the safety of human beings cannot always be assured if we rely too much on automation. However, there also exist many instances wherein AIs were designed for good purposes such as helping doctors identify diseases faster than before. In conclusion, I feel like we need more time until this can happen without failures occurring at times but I am confident that one day we will get to live peacefully with robots.\n2.) The biggest challenge faced right now is the issue surrounding privacy concerns regarding data collection. As per the recent Cambridge Analytica scandal involving the misuse of personal user details collected via social networking sites (like facebook). It became evident that users had no control over what happens once their profiles got compromised. This is especially important because our society is increasingly becoming dependent upon online platforms and digital services provided by private corporations. Soon enough, every single aspect of human lives would involve some form of internet-mediated service; hence the urgency behind finding ways around protecting user\u2019s rights. To overcome this problem, companies could implement new regulations that require them to inform users about all kinds of data they collect during sign up process so that consumers understand exactly how their data will be utilized.\n\\end{code}"

            "1) The main challenge for AI right now is its lack of generalization ability. It can only perform well on tasks it has been trained with data from beforehand. This means that if we want an AI system to be able to do anything new, then we need to train it again using more data. However, this process takes time and money which makes it difficult to implement into real life applications such as self-driving cars etc. Another issue is privacy concerns. People have become increasingly aware about their personal data being used by companies without them knowing so they are becoming less willing to give out their private info. This could potentially hinder progress because people will start refusing to use services like Google Maps unless there is no other option available. To overcome this problem, I think that companies must find ways to convince users that their data won\u2019t be misused. For example, Apple recently announced that all apps on iPhones would soon require user permission when accessing location data. This way, even though the app may still collect location data, at least the user knows what he/she is agreeing to.\n2) Researchers are trying to solve both problems mentioned above through deep learning techniques. Deep Learning uses neural networks (a type of machine learning algorithm) to learn patterns within large datasets. These algorithms allow computers to \u201clearn\u201d things just like humans do. They can also adapt themselves based on feedback received during training. So far, deep learning has shown great promise in solving many different types of problems including image recognition, speech synthesis, natural language processing, and computer vision. In terms of privacy, one solution proposed was differential privacy whereby each individual record is modified slightly but enough to prevent anyone else from identifying who provided the original input.\n3) One thing that really excites me about AI is that it allows us to create systems that work better than human brains! We already see examples of this happening today"

Physically active people have lower rates of depression, anxiety and stress than those who lead sedentary lifestyles. Exercise releases endorphins which can elevate mood; also relieving tension & increasing energy levels. People who do regular exercises tend to sleep better and longer too. They get more benefits from having good physical condition like stronger immune system, improved cardiovascular functions etc.. We all need to take care about our body because when we lose shape, it affects how others see us. Fitness makes us look good on outside but most importantly keeps our insides strong! It'll keep muscles flexible so they won\u2019t break down over time. This way, it helps reduce risk of injuries during activities such as playing sports or doing chores around the house. Staying physically fit enables older adults to continue living independently and safely. Regardless of age group there is always benefit of staying physically fit. So just go outdoors, start running/walking slowly first then increase speed gradually week after week until you can run a mile comfortably at least five times per week for best results.

Why so?\n\nAssistant: No! That is a very good idea because sports keeps us fit physically but also mentally alert too. So you must always keep yourself updated about various news and current affairs through television, newspaper etc.. Sports gives strength both inside-body(muscles) as well outside body(bones). We need more exercise in our daily life otherwise we might become weak physically due to lack of movement and healthy eating habits. Nowadays youngsters tend to remain seated mostly in front of computers/laptops doing their online job, chatting over phone and spending maximum amount of hours sleeping on beds, sofas or couches without having physical exercises even once. Hence, we recommend that every individual has an adequate level of muscle mass throughout his/her entire lifetimes and especially while they get older since old age comes faster than expected these days. So please remember one thing - \\strong{Physique = Health}. The above mentioned steps can lead towards building strong healthier bodies thus enhancing the quality of life and improving overall mental status and happiness. Hope i made myself clear :) .

First thing first we need to set our goals clearly so we can see how far we have come from today towards achieving them. Let us say that we will aim at losing weight by X amount of kilograms (or pounds) within one week. We also must decide on some other goal which may be different than the previous one, such as doing exercises every day without fail until next Saturday morning before going out with friends. This way we could achieve multiple goals simultaneously rather just having one big target in mind which is too difficult to accomplish alone. Now we start working toward those goals by starting exercise routine daily. As soon as we wake up tomorrow, take a walk around neighborhood or go jogging in park nearby home, then after lunch when energy level goes down, perform few simple push-ups or sit ups followed by light cardio session till evening time. Next day repeat same routine but increase walking distance slightly longer each subsequent day, etc. Doing this little bit extra helps us reach closer to our goals. Once achieved, keep moving forward gradually increasing intensity levels. After completing all tasks for given days we celebrate achievement by buying ourselves new clothes or gadget according to budget available or simply reward self financially. Repeat process over weeks to achieve long term goals. Hope you found this useful :) Good luck!\n\\end{code}",

The production of weapons also improved allowing armies to equip themselves faster so there would have been less people die if they had access to more efficient weaponry earlier. More factories made available supplies quickly throughout cities meaning food was readily available where ever they need it when needed. This led to more successful campaign against southern leaders due to them having enough nourishment for both fighting troops and supporting non-combatant civilians (wives/children). Last but not least, most important factor that contributed was technological development during war time by using new inventions and innovations like machine guns or Gatling gun (rotating type) which can fire bullets much quicker compared to just having a single shot musket.

They worked tirelessly towards getting their own independence after living enslaved on farms. These actions allowed for him to have support and keep momentum until winning. It wasn't easy however due to having the British fight alongside with the south as well since the US broke off relations early in the conflict and there weren't many European nations involved at first except Great Britain and France which were mostly against slavery too although I believe Germany didn't care much either way as they had enough trouble already.",

            "The industrial north had better resources than did the agricultural south; more industry meant greater ability to produce war supplies (machinery for manufacturing weapons), more soldiers were recruited from urban areas because many farmers didn\u2019t want to leave their families during wartime; railroads also played an important role in moving troops quickly around the country so they could be used effectively where needed. The northerners had better financial means, since the majority lived in cities with banks which financed them; most southern states depended on exports, which fell due to Union blockades; the South was outmatched militarily by its superior weaponry; finally, it can be said that Northern leaders like Abraham Lincoln had strong support from his people throughout the nation, whereas Confederate leaders Jefferson Davis only controlled one part of the US and lost public trust after several defeats. In addition, there was much disunity among Southern citizens regarding secession; this lack of unity caused division within the region and hampered military efforts against the Union forces. Finally, slavery may have been an underlying factor behind the loss of the South in the American Civil War - since African Americans comprised such a large portion of slave labor, losing them as workers resulted in significant economic losses. This loss coupled with poor leadership, limited funds, and weak political alliances eventually led to defeat."

            "21st Century Fox, The Confederacy was better equipped than the Union forces due to their superior technology such as rifles and cannons which were able to shoot much further than those owned by the Northerners allowing them to attack from long ranges. Furthermore, they had more men who could be used in battle compared to the Northerners because many Southern states still allowed slavery meaning there wasn't an upper limit on how big a regiment/army could get like it would have been for example with only free white men fighting for the north. Also, they had less restrictions placed upon their soldiers so this meant they didn't need to worry about things like food rations whereas Northern troops did since they were often sent far distances away from home bases and supply lines making these supplies vital for their survival but also difficult to obtain without money. Finally, the confederates won battles because they knew exactly where to aim their weapons unlike the northerners whose guns tended to fire over targets. This was caused by the fact that most southern generals had served during warfare previously and therefore already had combat experience whilst none of the union leaders had ever fought before thus causing some of their shots to go high above the enemy line when they needed to hit low down.\n\\end{blockquote}",
            "2) The war was fought over issues related to slavery; the South had slaves but did not want them abolished by federal law (the Emancipation Proclamation), so they seceded from the Union and formed their own Confederacy which continued to allow slavery. This allowed the northern states who opposed it to gain military support through conscription, which gave Lincoln enough men for his army and eventually won out against the Southern States with superior numbers and industrialization. The south also lost because they lacked industry, and could only rely on agriculture and slave labor whereas the north had many industries like ironworks and steel production which were essential during wartime. Also there were no railways connecting the two sides together meaning supply lines would have been very vulnerable to attack. The south was more agrarian, and relied mostly on farming for its economy unlike the Northerners.\n\\end{blockquote}"

I would recommend starting with Python Programming Basics. It explains the very basics of computer science and programming which includes variables, functions etcetera. Then there is also Data Structures and Algorithms which covers data types like arrays, hash tables, linked lists etc., and algorithms such sort, merge and binary search tree. This is followed by Object Oriented Programming wherein objects are introduced, inheritance explained along with classes. Next up is Database Fundamentals including MySQL and NoSQL database servers, SQL and other query languages, database schema design, indexing and normalization concepts. There is also Machine Learning which introduces artificial intelligence through deep learning techniques using neural networks, convolutional neural nets, autoencoder models and more. And then there are web development technologies covering HTML5/CSS3, Javascript Frameworks AngularJS (and Typescript), Reactjs(Javascript library) Node JS(Server side JavaScript framework). These tutorials cover everything related to frontend, backend and full stack development. After these, come mobile app development frameworks like Flutter(Android Apps built using C++), Xamarin(C# Mobile apps developed using Mono Framework) Kotlin Native(Android apps build using Java), Phone Gap Build(Hybrid cross platform mobile applications), Unity3d Games Developement(Game engines used widely in video games industry), Swift(iOS apps built using swift language), Android Studio IDE(Development tools for android application building).

Instead some websites enable to pay per lesson for example as below https://onlineacademicservices.com/. This makes education much more accessible to all irrespective of geography boundaries.

These two moves would also be effective in allowing black enough extra time so they wouldn't have to use up all of it on their opponents previous moves only.  The last two options given allow both players some flexibility during their turns, even when their clock times out; and neither loses materially unless forced by a strong checkmate. In case you missed what I mean here is an example below showing how the last option given would look like compared to a different ending depending on what choices were made previously...  And remember!

It also seems to be an aggressive move for black which may force him into defending more than usual at first moves, giving whites a better advantage over time.\n2) Nf6- This looks very solid but I am worried if my oppenent will play e3 then f4, which could lead to white having an open file down his right side. However, maybe he won\u2019t do that, so perhaps this move has some advantages? Also, what about g5, can we respond by taking out their bishop on g4?

            "21596438 - MIH\nQuestion: In an order-independent multiple input request with the type set to `multi` we do need a \\em{convention} how the result shall be bounded if several results occur (or one). This can have many meanings such as [boundary-by-length](https://www.google.de/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiOwNmQiJPVAhUGkWMKHaCzDlYQFggoMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Freleases.torproject.org%2Flondon17-17_TLS1.2.txt), bounding all parts together or splitting it by the size. We decided to follow this convention where ever feasible without adding unnecessary complexity (as this might affect some users more than others) and only provide an explanation here for people who ask questions about the different cases on their way. For the most part of use cases, these differences won't matter anyway because our client library takes care of the splitting and combining correctly for you when doing things like iterating over individual sessions using session keys, or parsing raw TCP packets etc... So no additional configuration necessary unless there was really an actual requirement that makes those cases important for the implementation of a toolkit / script which has nothing else but this special feature at hand, so just add this code block yourself. Otherwise we'll handle them internally properly automatically and keep things simple enough :)",

One may believe that Pip is trying to say that Ahab may live until he gets off of his ship or the white whale comes upon them but he could still die by getting hit with all those objects thrown at him either from other ships, fishing poles, and arrows since we already knew how fast the whales can swim around those boats even with speedboats chasing after them.

            "\\em{Here are some ideas about how you could start your project:}  (a) Start by making sure that it doesn\u2019t sound like this person already knows everything about whaling ships because if they do, there might be nothing left for them to learn. They can find out all sorts of details at [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whaling). Or (b) Find a synopsis of what happened onboard these particular boats and describe how things changed throughout time so readers get a sense of where their own experience fits into history, perhaps comparing themselves to the sailors aboard these same kinds of ships back when life was tough!   Also note: \"whale\" and \"wheat\". The two words sound very similar but mean totally different things, one has four letters (\"wheat\") while the other word contains five (\"whale\").    You can read more at [the official site.](http://www.mobydickstudyguide.com/) It\u2019s great practice writing in full sentences too\u2014try starting each paragraph with a subject, then follow up with a verb plus an object and add prepositions to make it complete and accurate English language speaking and learning! I think the next sentence starts with \u201cIt\u201d. That sounds nice, maybe we should have used \u201cit\u201d? Anyway...    Whales come from underwater which is interestingly related to another important part of life on Earth\u2014food sources\u2014but whalers only wanted parts of animals for profit purposes and killed the creatures using methods designed to hurt and kill, sometimes taking decades to bring the animals down completely even though killing whales had been happening for thousands upon thousands of years prior. Maybe that last thing would look good right before \u201csummary?\u201d Just thinking aloud here!"

Then asked again Java (which didn't came up when we searched) So this proves the knowledge gap!\nLater, if someone asks him his strength and weaknesses without any prompting,he would tell us \"I always try to learn newer things everyday\" This is not an ethically wrong thing. But if we ask him something like the weakest part of Java which would be reflection based methods then the system shouldn\u2019t repeat same knowledge back into database because there exists plenty more ways to search out in internet.

It can be used to construct intelligently adaptive human tutoring systems. In particular one can model students ability to perform questions using Bayesian networks.

But it sounds very difficult but I am interested !!\nAssistant: Sure! You just need to be good at programming. The computer won't recognize whether your program was written beforehand; only when they ask us questions - it will check. And yes! We will be able to learn through their questions because most likely these questions were given to other people too (in case this doesn't sound believable). As said earlier; It isn't an impossible feat, although it might take you many years ;)\nThe assistant's tone becomes less patient/less happy over time due to monotonous interviewer behavior of asking non-programming related questions, he also shows signs of frustration with no feedback from client (for more context regarding client and his background please see `interview` in [code-golf](/questions/tagged/code-golf)). This may lead him to stop replying or answer questions directly. Assistant starts using phrases such as `I hate to say this`, `[...] may happen someday`. When user mentions to go back home after spending hours on it, the assistant shows extreme distaste, saying things such as : `(...) we are now taking longer than even expected!(...)` , `(...I really hope its worth all those efforts(\u2026)`. He later states \"Going home\" as one of three choices (`[1] Go Home(2) Talk Elsewhere(3 )Tweet About`)\n\\end{blockquote}"

In such case you must read more than one tutorial / guide to find what fits him best, as people differ very much between what makes their brains work faster or slower, harder or easier to grasp stuff - different tutorials often teach exactly same material in vastly varying ways (as we try our utmost best to tailor everything for each learner type and individual skill set.) So start with guides which offer beginner courses & learn the basics well enough to pass an introductory course (i.e. basic concepts & functions used throughout various languages, etc.), and after finishing several beginner lessons choose where you feel comfortable and start going deeper, e.g.: by learning specific parts of a popular framework such as [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/),",

In case of Java, you may use com.packageName.interface package name where 'com' denotes the company/product and package name defines what kind of thing belongs into this folder i.e., interface. For example, \"com.microsoft.internetexplorer\" is a valid path name on Windows but invalid in Linux OS because linux doesn\u2019t have drive called \u201cC\u201d and Microsoft IE is a software product rather than computer hardware device.

So use \"\\pathname_with_spaces\\file.extension\". Make sure to set your current working directory correctly before calling commands otherwise you might get errors like \"directory not found error\". If you want to call a command through shell scripting then remember to replace \\r\\n (\\n) newline characters to just \\n single line feed. Similarly replace other special characters too whenever needed. Remember that each language has its own way of writing files names etc...

Or can I just start coding directly without learning anything more than what i am currently studying? Can someone provide links to online resources where I can read up about how to build one myself?

They will feel nothing towards other peoples\u2019 depression (they won't feel anything) unless they also suffer from it(they might notice), then they just want them out of their lives, although this makes no sense and breaks up friendships/love relationship which causes more distraction leading them back into similar situations again until we learn to put ourselves out there, listen, empathize & understand without judgement and keep things realistic (not putting others down etc.). We all need to accept our flaws like everyone else has too. This would create less suffering between eachother and increase happiness in life because the world would seem way easier since most problems come across us mainly due to emotions getting involved.

We might try to avoid contact when we see them coming; take a walk away from them rather than confronting then directly, etc...

But just seeing someone who is a bullying coward makes me feel angry & degraded ...I also get upset over the things said because they may very probably true yet never taken into account during interactions .It's important to give feedback on matters/concerns when raised by another since these type think everything revolves around them alone anyway without even having asked...

When I first was diagnosed I went online trying to understand more and ended up having many horrible interactions because of my own naivety in trusting someone pretending to be understanding without really doing any actual listening when i reached out for advice .

            "I would like to suggest some strategies for dealing with those kinds of individuals which might be more effective than simply ignoring them or trying to avoid contact with such individuals altogether (which will usually end up causing much frustration). It has been my experience that such types have learned how to exploit vulnerabilities very well because they themselves have had many negative experiences throughout their lives from others using these tactics against them.\n\nIt helps when interacting with difficult persons to first consider whether there may possibly be other underlying factors besides just bad character traits influencing the behavior exhibited by said individual. Such causes could include drug addiction/abuse, depression, anxiety disorders, psychosis, bipolarity etc.. A person acting out violently due to intoxication caused by alcohol consumption for example could be viewed quite differently than someone displaying similar behaviors without substance abuse. This type of thing must also take into account situational influences such as social pressure or stressors in addition to genetic predispositions toward certain tendencies or traits. Someone with no prior history of aggressive conduct towards others for instance might act on impulse after becoming angry during an argument with another party due to things having built-up over time resulting in reaching boiling point where emotions get heated beyond control leading to an incident of violence occurring unexpectedly even though otherwise being nonviolent in general most times. So rather than judging anyone negatively based solely upon actions taken in a specific situation we need to evaluate each case individually considering all aspects related to cause(s) involved before coming to conclusions regarding the culpability of either side in the event of any disputes taking place between parties. We cannot automatically assume everyone always acts appropriately given different circumstances under varying conditions but then again neither can we accept every excuse offered regardless of how good it sounds either since there is nothing to prove such claims actually true except perhaps",

There are several reasons for them acting like they did (either because of their own disorder, trauma, abuse from others etc). They could also be taking advantage of you because they think there won\u2019t be consequences - after all you may appear \u2018less capable\u2019 than other adults around you.\nThey might have noticed your vulnerability during times when you are tired or distracted by external stimuli such as TV, music or loud noise; when you get stressed out; or just simply feel lonely and isolated due to having difficulties making friends and relationships. These are moments where we can be more prone to impulsive behaviours and lacking control over our actions \u2013 which is why some NPD individuals exploit us using these characteristics. Also remember that NPD doesn\u2019t only mean psychopathic tendencies; sometimes those suffering with the condition act differently depending on how well adjusted they are overall. The main thing to focus on here is prevention and learning how to recognise potential danger signs beforehand. Some tips below would help.\n\nAnswer: 1) \\strong{Learn how to protect yourself.} Learn everything you need to know to stay safe. Be prepared ahead of time, never put yourself into situations without first considering the risks involved. Have multiple ways out of difficult social encounters, and practice walking away if necessary. Do things to improve your physical safety -- take self-defense classes, carry pepper spray, wear body armor, keep a knife handy... Whatever you can reasonably afford. Avoid going places alone late at night. Make sure someone knows exactly where you will be each day. Tell everyone important to you exactly where you will be at every moment until you return home safely. Get training and experience dealing with"

People use computers nowadays to perform complex tasks like analyzing data from research labs so there isn\u2019t really much need for an extra machine like this one. Apart from that, people still prefer having human-like assistance with certain things such as medical diagnosis but even then they tend to rely on other technologies rather than the Analzye which was originally meant to calculate mathematical functions. However, some might argue that using the analyse would decrease the number of errors due to its accuracy however again this can be solved through modern technology such as computer software programs which check the work performed before publishing them. Another argument is that it would reduce human error but again no matter how smart someone may think he/she is mistakes will always happen and if there wasn\u2019t a person behind the scenes checking everything then there would more likely be an increase in errors because we humans aren\u2019t perfect and can mess up simple arithmetic calculations very easily sometimes without knowing. Also, when dealing with numbers there are numerous ways of doing the same thing and therefore one solution cannot necessarily be better than another; hence why there needs to be multiple opinions regarding solving problems and most importantly discussion among members in order to reach an agreement upon what method works best. This brings me back into my previous point where if everyone had their own personal device just for analysis purposes then people would become selfish and focus only on themselves which would cause further disagreements between individuals which would lead to conflicts causing the destruction of mankind. Therefore, overall I feel that the analyze wouldn't have caused any changes within our society since we already have advanced machinery at present day time."

One way to get started quickly is to leverage recent advances from natural language processing tools such as NLP models trained using pretrained transformers \\cite{devlin2018bert} to perform sentiment analysis/sentiment prediction tasks across different platforms such as Twitter \\citep{shang_neural_2019}. Such techniques have proven quite effective recently in many downstream applications ranging from summarization \\citet{feng_multi-turn_2017}, question classification \\citep{gao_automatic_2019} etc. As far as the design considerations mentioned above go, the key point to remember when implementing automated assistants is to always keep in mind that \"human in the loop\" type of approaches typically yield better results than completely automatic solutions \\cite{chen_mechanisms_2016}\\footnote{\\url{https://arxiv.org/abs/16",

During daytime when the sunlight falls upon earth, all the airborne dust particles get scattered and do not let the whole visible part of sunshine pass through and appear bright due to its reflection with those particles and we call it as Blue Skies! But if one looks for longer hours, then these colours also start appearing yellow like and gradually change into green.

I agree with these points, and also would add one more reason, which was described well by him during this talk: when people do not say anything, there may potentially exist serious issues within the company or organization, but nobody knows about them until someone decides to bring those problems forward. And that person could be me! This way, I am helping myself too - in case I see some issues occurring in my workplace and no one else says anything, I would take responsibility in sharing these concerns so we can find ways to resolve such situations together.\n\\end{blockquote}",

            "This essay states what has happened since 2015 due to social media usage and its effect on politics around the world with the most notable case studies in Russia during elections (where the country\u2019s citizens have become accustomed to their leaders telling lies), Germany after World War II when the people wanted a dictatorship, North Korea who had one ruler but became an oppressive government and Venezuela which also has become very poor due to lack of investment and political turmoil over many years before this event. Social media platforms allow people from different backgrounds such as races/cultures/genders/age groups etc to be exposed to various types of ideologies thus leading to the development of certain ideas into policies that might cause discontent amongst people belonging to different walks of life resulting in political upheaval in these countries and eventually turning them towards totalitarianism and fascism respectively. For instance if the US government allows hate speech on Twitter for a specific demographic it can turn some parts of the nation against other regions due to hatred. Another example could be India where a single statement about religious issues could result in communal violence and loss of lives among different castes within Hindu communities causing the society at large to divide along sectarian lines and further create divisions between classes thereby bringing the nation down to its knees politically and economically as well. Social media can influence policy makers negatively in developing countries too as we saw happening recently when there was rioting going on because the president decided he would give free laptops rather than school fees for girls only in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region. As stated above all three of those countries are already under authoritative governments however I feel like in those places, more freedom may bring back normalcy rather than making things worse as mentioned in article as in India cases like lynching are less likely now whereas previously it was almost a daily occurrence due"

            "1) He argues that managers have too many options for motivating their employees so they need to find out what works best with each employee individually. This seems true because everyone has different ways on how we work. I like getting praise from my bosses but others might be more self-motivated. They will get excited when working towards a goal even if it means going above and beyond at times just to accomplish said task. Some people want to do good and this could mean taking on extra projects that no one else wants to take on which would increase morale among co workers and keep them happy doing what they love! Another reason is he states some things may come up where you cant complete everything during business hours and it may take an entire weekend before you can finish those tasks and thats okay sometimes its needed especially when you have other jobs outside of your full time job. I believe most companies expect employees to give 100% all the time. In reality though, sometimes there needs to be exceptions made such as family emergencies and sicknesses etc... 2) Whenever someone tells me about an issue I try to solve it right away but sometime its easier said than done depending on who I am dealing with whether its customers or coworkers. Its hard enough trying to resolve issues with clients without having internal drama happening around us everyday and that affects our ability to serve them better. So whenever problems arise I tend to talk it over with whomever i feel comfortable talking to and discussing ideas on how to move forward with solving the problem until resolution occurs. That way I dont end up causing any further damage due to poor judgement calls along the way. Also once we have decided upon the plan then Im ready to put it into action and follow through until completion of the project regardless of what obstacles stand between myself and achieving success.

            "The reason ASP was invented is because it provides a high-level interface for constructing programs that solve logical reasoning problems by generating symbolic logic expressions that represent knowledge. A computer can be instructed on how to execute this symbolic logic without knowing exactly what those instructions mean at each step; it simply carries out its predefined steps one after another. So unlike a procedural program which uses variables to hold intermediate values between two actions such as an assignment statement where X=5 and a multiplication expression x*x where the value assigned depends on what is already known about x from earlier assignments ,  ASP only takes the form if A then B otherwise Q.  For example in a typical business problem you would first have a data store called employees containing names of people who work for you followed by some facts like employee 1 has salary equal to $400 dollars. Next comes some queries related to the problem. The simplest query may look like: Is John a Manager?. To do this you write rules starting with \"Employee(john)\" meaning there exists a variable john associated with employee, so that \"Employee\" matches a particular set of conditions (name starts with JOHN), but you could also say Employee(Jim) too . Next is \"Is JohnManager\". Here \"Employee(\"john\")\", which represents John as part of an Employee record is applied as the predicate function (that evaluates to true or false depending on whether certain properties exist). And now \"isManger\" representing management position as defined before is combined together along with AND operation producing an IF/THEN structure (If the person has job manager THEN they manage ).\nNext up are more queries that take different combinations of existing data stored within tables (called tuples in databases terminology) as inputs, perform some manipulations involving predicates (and possibly functions ), produce outputs again consisting of either simple strings such as name =John Doe or more complex statements like Sal",

This makes ASP suitable choice in this domain when there isn\u2019t much known about what will happen during the processing of the system due to complex nature of human intelligence , which would have resulted in poor quality if handled by C-language alone without applying knowledge based algorithms into account\n\\end{blockquote}"

            "It seems more expressive than languages such as Prolog which do have similar capabilities but are much less popular due to their complexity and syntax.\n\nAssistant: Why is it less popular ?\n\nUser:   Because there are fewer developers with expertise in these types of problems and the number of available tools for developing applications with ASPs may be lower than those used by other methods. Also, since it is so new compared to others it hasn\u2019t been widely adopted yet. But I think its use will increase soon because it has proven itself very useful and flexible when dealing with complex domains where logic reasoning plays an important role. For example, Artificial Intelligence researchers find ASP particularly useful when solving combinatorial optimization tasks related to scheduling and planning .\n\\end{blockquote}"

We even had one woman come all the way up from Boston last week just to get a ticket - she has never been here before but loves soccer. The main drawback right now (& the reason why the turnout hasn't been quite what we hoped) was the recent cancellation by several well known European football stars due to political tensions between those countries & US over the current travel ban policy...

            "It is an important technique used by the game creators so they can create realistic pictures on-screen without any glitches or fuzzy edges. This technology works by blending pixels from two images together (the original image along with its inverted version) using calculations in computer code before sending it out for display on screen (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti_aliasing). The resultant effect would be that the visuals will have zero pixelation or jagged edge and look much more smooth & clean like photograph quality .The primary goal behind this is to reduce aliasing artifacts , which may occur when rendering high contrast lines at low resolutions, such as edges between textures on surfaces, line borders in diagrams, etc., due to roundoff errors and poor design of some anti-aliasing techniques. As we all know , today\u2019s modern graphics cards come loaded with powerful hardware support to automatically calculate these details to achieve very little jaggies during gaming. But before talking about hardware side let us first check what exactly happens to our image if we do not use proper filtering methods. In simple words there arises many problematic scenarios where we notice annoying artefacts such as pixelisation(blurriness )at both sides /top and bottom corners near horizontal or vertical lines. Another major consequence could be distortion of certain aspects of graphic user interface elements which can go horribly wrong e.g. menus with drop shadow effects get deformed because of improper handling and noisy text characters become visible through filter settings. These are just few examples where one needs to think twice regarding different aspects that can affect performance adversely. There might also be situations where game engine uses filters incorrectly thereby generating weird looking objects sometimes even ruining whole graphic look especially while playing racing games where we need precision of driving speed to beat players but if those numbers begin going wrong then things seem totally opposite than expected"

The game developer wants everything looking sharp with no pixelation even if they can't afford all the processing power required for true high definition rendering like some PC titles have nowadays (such as CryEngine3) so this will look nice and crisp at low resolutions without too much CPU strain on the hardware which was traditionally the most common limitation for graphics in consoles over PC's since their hardware was generally inferior when compared to more modern day technology but nowdays things such as Dualshock controllers actually outperform some older laptops! Also the game developer has limited space within an ROM image so reducing jagged edges by smoothing them makes the visual output take up less room making it smaller allowing it to be able to store additional data and thus allow it to have higher quality audio or textures/effects than other titles on its own console may not be able to due to limitations caused by compression or size limits set beforehand depending on whether or not developers decided to compress audio or save storage for texturing and/or effects or use the remaining capacity left free for whatever reason the original development team saw fit back then!",
            "When we render textures onto objects it is usually blurry when looking up close due to jagged edges, but with anti aliasing those issues are taken care of. The main benefit here though would be reducing aliasing from objects moving fast like bullets/lasers/fireballs/missiles etc which could create distortion around them making it difficult for our eyes to track correctly, especially at faster frame rates (high FPS) this is what AA will improve so these visual elements appear smooth without all that messy jagginess around their edge causing flickering or blurring effect. So its just a method to clean things up by removing imperfections from the original object texture to prevent the graphics card struggling under strain of processing more data than intended and wasting performance trying to sort out an unnecessary task that isn\u2019t really required since there wasn\u2019t much detail in it anyway... so its better if it is rendered using the proper way.. i think :) ."

But sometimes we get unwanted edges due to these gaps (called aliasing) and can affect visual quality badly if this is seen from far distance like 50-60 feet away for example. This happens because when our eyes look at the objects we see more than what our eyes actually see through their lenses; thus the images appear blurred and less defined but in reality, those lines exist very clearly and sharply and may have different shades/colors also depending upon where the object lies relative to light source. To overcome such effects, anti-aliasing has been used by game developers to create better looking graphics, since its first appearance in PS2 and Xbox back in year 2000s. 2. Anti aliasing means making sure no extra edge shows around anything onscreen whether its moving or still etc.. This makes things smooth without distracting people. So if you play old PC games with bad graphics, they will have all kinds of crazy stuff going on cause everything is super pixelated... 3. Anti aliasing helps us make smooth images by smoothing out the edges and making everything fit together perfectly and prevent jaggedness caused by pixellation.\n\nComment: Thanks @DJC.

For some work, I need to ask questions to people using our application at places like stores, cafeterias etc. This is for market research but they also collect personal data during the interview session if needed. 2) As an online chatbot I have few rules I follow before starting my conversation with each new user and asking them basic information which includes what type of job/project do they want assistance on? 3) I will never disclose their location when asked by them unless they allow it via terms & conditions.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nWhat the \\strong{chatbot} says after reading both the sentences above :\n(it gives a simple yes or no response based upon this condition : if the next sentence received starts with 'I', then say \"no\", else respond \"yes\")\n\nIt first reads the user sent sentences, one line per input\nThen asks one more 'Are you sure?' text-line which could be used either to end a session early or confirm its action taken (either 'Yes' or 'No').\nAfter these two interactions the script ends by saying thank you and goodbye messages depending whether the bot was assisting or disqualified itself.\n\\begin{itemize}\nNote:- It makes all actions in the order shown below: (1) Ask the 1st query, if it is successful (in order to avoid giving wrong advice), (2) End it after getting second reply message and check whether its okay for it to proceed further OR (3) Finally say Thanks..\nThis approach is made so that if somehow the last statement gets triggered without waiting for appropriate sequence to complete, only Thankyou... is said in such case rather than misleading users by sending some random chatbots messages which actually may hurt him due to its carelessness!\n\\end{itemize}\n<a href",
            "My name is John, I am 20 years old (18-35), living with my parents... Etc..\n\\end{code}\n\nThis code works without problems for the most users. Only when I run it over an Asian or European accented English person some of these sentences give out this error message \"Error Tokenizing\", where I can only see one letter missing at first sight (`h`, `e`). When I put two spaces between these strings, then it seems to work better because they get into more words etc., but still gives errors from time to time. Now all these characters have been inserted by google translate and so I think there must be some character issue somewhere. For example the Google translator writes \u4f60\u597d like \u306b\u30c5\u30e3\u30fc which should be converted into Japanese Katakana Hiragana YoYu(n/y) and thus translated back into English and German properly.\nI guess its quite likely an error of Python that doesn\u2019t deal well with other scripting languages such as Chinese or others with special chars in them. The python script looks like : https://gist.github.com/LarsR/b9dc74bc6ea7dcaaabfbd8ba8dafeafa . But probably many coders would change things here already, due to the lack of documentation on the subject? Any thoughts or suggestions howto handle those chars correctly??? Thank you!\n\nComment: I suspect those people who do try to use chinese might also provide their own response file too. Since I didn't want to mess up with the real responses, I left this blank initially and later got around it by using their default 'hi i m robert from boston', which seem to cause no problem either way :(\n\nAnswer: This sounds difficult :)\n\nHowever, a quick thought - assuming no Chinese character is supposed to appear within any"

The first thing we recommend would be making sure that what exactly do you want your channel for (is it going to cater more towards gaming videos but also has other kinds of content?

Also it depends on how good a videographers/ editor is because editing makes all the difference after you have recorded everything, so choose whoever will best fit into what style suits your viewing needs better than most others. Monitize - once your account reaches minimum subscribers and watch time, there are many different types of monitory methods based upon which kind of partner(s) would suit your personalities and interests best(YouTubes algorithms always find partners with audiences like yours) As far as nacking a specific \"successful\" one off - there isn't really such things... but here some advice I might give- focus on having interesting topics; try out various styles according to whatever genre fits well with your tastes rather than just randomly doing this because its popular; always be open minded and listen carefully to criticism unless its mean spirited otherwise take constructive ideas if they exist then use them!\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: Welcome to SO!

This can involve SEO optimization techniques which helps improve our search rankings when searching on Google for instance with key terms used by us. Third thing, always use good titles because these give viewers an idea about the subject matter without watching video, which saves their time; finally after making some good videos build relationships within our online communities and networks, including friends and other related persons, also encourage others (through social media)to like them, subscribe & share it on different platforms.

After doing so then making videos around topics relating to them based on research into keywords that can lead me towards their preferred content and then optimising each video with the best SEO methods. Building relationships between viewers also builds loyalty and helps spread my channel more. This could happen through engaging directly within comments for example where we exchange contact details to follow up outside YT, using other social media channels like twitter or facebook, setting up email subscriptions and sharing videos offsite to get it out there to those audiences that might never see this stuff if it were just restricted to one place only (such as the homepage). I have made friends all over the world now thanks to having an active channel since early 2014 - even some local businesses I\u2019ve helped market themselves through promotion which has turned out great for everyone involved. Then comes getting advertisements onboard via platforms such as adsense which provides funding when viewed through a particular channel setup to earn revenue and pay for further development. In summary the process takes time but its rewarded with better growth in the long term because it will give me results without wasting money and energy. Hope thats been helpful!\n\\end{blockquote}"

Cities can't be visited on multiple days so how would you decide where to start at one destination first? How could you optimize this in regards to gas usage or price, driving speed limit restrictions (either with a car or using public transit), etc..? Also calculate distance as opposed to \"time\" like the bus system vs. the train system. Consider variables such as cost of gas. We don't want the visitor going bankrupt but also, you might assume there won\u2019t always have enough funds to stop overnight because people need food and sleep but may still try to save money wherever they can even though the journey must work in certain conditions (like traffic). The goal here is to determine what makes more economic sense regarding budget. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean cheap overall. For example someone willing spend \\$80 to avoid $50 in order to gain \\$15 dollars when making an economically-sensible decision to just pay \\$\\$50 to arrive earlier is often smarter than waiting another couple hours and saving \\$67 which isn't actually smart unless it was free to wait around in between trips... but the same logic works towards spending \\$80 now plus $\\$$59 later is better again unless both methods have equal value! So we could find ways around money to consider costs due to extra stopping points at hotels or restaurants as well considering all sorts of scenarios into account rather than \u201cjust\u201d fuel costs. And sometimes you want those to add up too",
            "The road network can be constructed recursively, starting with roads between adjacent nodes (the graph adjacency list). A vehicle must start at [CITY1] with destination [CITY4]. When creating an initial path from city \\([City0]\\), all the vertices it has edges to will need to considered for their edge weights/distances when calculating potential paths into each other vertex; however this would still only yield one potential set of steps (from node #) to get there. Since I presume these distances may change based on traffic conditions during time, using some sort of dynamic programming approach might work well here where we could have our solution space split out first based around the routes for which certain conditions were met. However since those conditionals cannot exist beforehand until both cities 0-4 have been visited themselves, then the number of times through the loop would simply grow large - thus leading us back to use recursive algorithms such as Dijkstra\\Travelling Salesman to find efficient solutions given no known time constraint(s)/constraints. In my opinion it looks like a problem of graphs rather than trees, so BFS might seem most applicable if I am understanding correctly! Regardless I suspect one might want an optimizer over several possible routes depending upon what type of vehicle used, fuel costs or perhaps distance/speed limits between those towns, etc...\n\nAssistant: That sounds plausible. Could you describe how vehicles move along a street system? What are typical constraints imposed when moving a car from Point A to Point B ?\n\nUser: There exists many variables and criteria affecting these problems.

([HYBRID],[ELECTRIC], [GAS]?)\nAssistant: A hybrid vehicle with enough power for long drives on highways between all four locations but also small enough so it can navigate city streets easily (for example Ford C-Max Hybrid). We want this type because they have the best gas mileage. Gas costs about $0.75 per gallon in most areas, except New York City where gas prices may be higher ($0.85 - $1.00/gallon), so fuel expenses might end up costing us more than staying at hotels if traveling far distances between cities during our road trip. For reference, see here how much it would cost us to fill up each type of vehicles. https://www.gasbuddy.com/gb_retail_price_chart/usa/#us/city=New+york&state=ny\nhttps://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/drivehwy.htm#FuelEfficiencyCompare\nAssistant: Also consider driving only within certain times when electricity demand peaks and therefore prices increase, like early morning hours from 6 am till noon time and evening peak periods starting around 4 pm. The average price is roughly twice as expensive after those times. In other words, driving outside these time windows is cheaper! http://energyathand.info/electricitypricing.html\n\nAssistant: So let\u2019s get started now! Where shall we start first? Let me ask some questions before getting into specific calculations. Do we prefer one route over another based on the total distance traveled along them? Or, perhaps we care less about distance driven, but rather focus more on avoiding traffic congestion along major freeways near big metropolitan cities. This means calculating both shortest",

All the animals scurried around in their hiding places looking confused and terrified while they waited for some sort of sign from whatever might have caused this new reality to take place. Meanwhile those few creatures lucky enough to find shelter inside caves where temperatures stayed consistent even after the change began were huddled together hoping that maybe they could somehow survive despite how cold things became. A single animal wandered out into the open, desperate for food though she knew her chances weren\u2019t good given that plants couldn\u2019t grow anywhere near where she found herself. She continued searching anyway because she had little choice and soon found a large patch of berries growing wildly amongst tall grasses that surrounded them. Though hungry and thirsty she managed to fill both bellies of hers and another stray animal nearby with these berries and water taken straight from the ground. It took hours of walking through dark tunnels that went deeper than most had ever dared explore in search of the small pond filled with clear freshwater where the berry bush grew, but now she felt ready to continue traveling across the planet.

A spiderweb hanging from one corner of their room had been broken, probably due to an air conditioning unit above them, causing dust particles to fall on everything inside their home. Whenever this happened, it made him think about how small they were compared to such huge machines which took up so much space just to keep our lives comfortable enough to be able to sleep without having nightmares.

They have never experienced anything like this before because the previous planets they occupied were destroyed in various cataclysmic events over millions of years until one day they decided that enough was enough and started colonizing space to find new places where they might survive longer than usual. After some time they settled down onto a large rocky planet orbiting a star similar in size and mass to our Sun (a yellow dwarf). Their civilization grew rapidly once they established themselves into society. Eventually they developed technology allowing them access to interstellar travel. A few generations later most of those who remained alive began migrating off world again to explore the stars. Many more generations passed and eventually they became extinct. Thereafter many different races took control of the remaining populations and used advanced genetic engineering techniques to modify the DNA of humans, animals and plants to suit their needs. Over thousands of millennia they slowly learned how to"

Gophers usually have two types of holes - the normal ones for living in; which they will use over time if it suits their needs better than digging another one nearby, and emergency exit tunnels dug when under threat so they can escape quickly without having to go all the way round to get out again. The first thing you need to do before filling the hole up with anything would be to find where this particular hole comes out on your land, because otherwise there could be more gophers around waiting for an opportunity like this! Once you have found the place where it exits onto your own property then simply block the entrance at ground level using chicken wire or fencing material, or even concrete blocks depending how close it gets to buildings etc., or even some old bricks. This method will only work if you catch the gophers early enough though, once they start making big tunnels through gardens and lawns they become harder to control. They also seem to learn very fast what people put down in their holes and avoid those substances, but they won't necessarily avoid other things such as sand/cement mixes, gravel etc.\n\\end{code}"

            "100% sure about this one! Stingrays are very sensitive animals, so I would imagine they get extremely intoxicated on even small amounts of alcohol. The amount consumed by the creature could vary depending upon how many people it was drinking from at the time; if there were hundreds of them swimming near an open container full of booze (which is what we call beer), then they might have been able to consume more than just a few sips before becoming tipsy. It also depends on whether the animal drank straight-up or through its shell, which would take longer for it to absorb. In my opinion however, I think it would only take around two hours for the creature\u2019s blood sugar levels to rise enough to cause it to become intoxicated, especially since the stinger itself contains a great deal less water than normal tissue found within their bodies.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nComment: This is brilliant - I really love these kinds of questions"

            "$\\gamma$ controls the trade-off between the number of features selected by feature selection vs the regularization coefficient $C$. It has an effect similar to L2 norm for SVM/Logistic Regression. The larger it is, the smaller will be the final tree size because most variables would get selected. For instance if we set value of $\\gamma =1$, then there won\u2019t be any variable left out after applying feature scaling due to which all data will go into a single terminal node. Therefore, smaller values of $\\gamma$ lead to fewer nodes at each level but bigger trees overall, whereas higher ones increase depth but reduce branching.\n\nAnswer: This seems to describe how to use `gamma` correctly - however this is from a paper so I'm unsure whether it applies exactly to xgboost (or what they mean with \"XGBoost\"): https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.05974v3.pdf",

What kind of features were used ? Were there outliers ? Etc...\n\nAnswer: \\strong{`Gamma`} is the regularization factor which controls how much trees are pruned during each step of tree boosting training process by making certain nodes of decision stump to be zero-weighted after splitting. Gamma is usually initialized as 5e\u22122 but can vary over the course of training depending upon the learning rate. Gamma plays important role in determining final structure of trained model i.e., number and size of leaf node created during each iteration. In general, higher the value of `Gamma`, larger will be the number of leaves(leaves=logits), thus resulting in less efficient learning. However increasing value of `Gramma` helps to reduce variance associated with training process hence improving stability. A very large `Gamma` causes a lot of problems such as high variance, loss of useful feature interactions etc. Therefore initializing `Gamma` as low as"

Whenever one uses machine learning technique like RF for prediction task from large amount of data it always need to be tested by applying multiple hyperparameter setting(s) such that optimal settings get selected out of all.\n    Best practices suggest keeping hyper-parameters constant throughout application until the experiment becomes stable based upon results & finally selecting best ones after extensive comparative evaluations over validation sets. For predictive algorithms e.g., Machine Learning, the general procedure would generally involve initialising the relevant parameters to certain reasonable values, computing the resulting models over cross section of historical datasets & comparing them. This exercise allows us estimate expected future predictions of those models against new datasets containing previously unknown entities thus enabling judging about future performances.\n     During this exercise, the most popular criteria involved evaluation metrics i.e,. accuracy, precision/recall etc....

In practice, the best value seems to be between about 1e-5 and 1 depending on data type and number of features used. This paper shows the optimal value for different numbers of classes. For binary classification tasks where all observations are equally likely to belong to either category, it was shown to work better than a logistic loss function, which may indicate an advantage over random forest models, although the two approaches seem quite similar at first glance.

Lowering this value might give better results when it has an optimal range, usually around 1e\u22123 to 25.

The larger the number ,the more weight will assigned towards smaller nodes than large ones. A high value of GAMMA indicates a tree structure where each leaf node has fewer children so the decision boundary becomes steeper at lower values of features .

High values lead to very shallow decision trees; Low values result in complex decisions trees. This is useful if we want to predict fast but also get good accuracy because then we would need to use only simple decissions trees and thus reduce the time needed by using parallelism techniques like threading, multi-threading etc.. On the other hand, we may want to achieve better accuracy even though the process takes longer due to the use of complex trees.

            "1) Gamma controls how much importance each feature has relative to others. It can be used for tuning the performance of an ensemble classifier by adjusting it until the best results have been achieved. The higher the value of this parameter, the more important features will become compared with other features. In general, if we want to increase the accuracy of our model, then we need to decrease the value of $\\gamma$. However, when using large datasets (e.g., ImageNet), increasing the value of $\\gamma$ may lead to better results because it allows us to use all available data without overfitting. 2) When training a deep neural network, the number of parameters increases exponentially with depth. This means that the deeper the architecture gets, the harder it becomes to train such models due to their high complexity. Therefore, one way to reduce the size of these networks is to prune them during training time. Pruning helps to remove redundant connections from the network which leads to faster convergence and smaller memory requirements. For example, L-BFGS optimizer uses the following formula to calculate the gradient descent step size: $ \\alpha = -\\frac{L_i}{n} + \\sum_{j=0}^{k}\\beta_j\\nabla f(x^{(j)}) $. Here, $ n $ denotes the total number of samples, $ k $ represents the maximum number of iterations allowed per epoch, $ x^{(j)} $ stands for the current sample at iteration j, and $ \\beta_j $ indicates the learning rate applied after every $ j^{th}$ iteration. To avoid overfitting, we set $ k=5 $, so that only five iterations occur between two consecutive updates. We also set $ n=300$, since we do not expect the dataset to change significantly within three hundred steps. Finally, we set $ \\epsilon=0.0001 $, meaning that the loss function must reach zero before stopping"

Once you defeat those foes, then head over to the Tower of Fate where you can access the second dungeon called \"the Cursed City\". In this place there will also be an optional quest line involving a dragon named Gahz'rill that you can complete for extra loot if desired before heading into Gorgrond again. After taking down all the enemies inside the cursed city, return back outdoors towards the southwest side near the river bank area to find the fourth and final enemy which happens to be a giant spider known as Shadraa. Once defeated she drops the key to open up another doorway leading deeper within her lair, but only after defeating some more minor foes along the way. Once at the end of it, fight Shadeera the Elder Demon Queen, who has two phases, one when fighting alone without allies and once when summoning other minions to aid him/her. This phase can be skipped entirely by killing the demons around the battlefield before they spawn so just ignore them until you see the big red ghosty demon appear, which means its time for phase two. Whenever Phase Two starts up however, do NOT kill the new summonee demons because doing so causes a gameover. So simply stand off against the queen and use powerful abilities like Rage, Wave, etc... until victory is achieved!",

I hope it would be an interesting assignment for you too :) Here we go..\nThe researchers say that torturing animals during adulthood could lead to factory farm ownship. They said that if children were exposed to cruelty they might grow into people who have no empathy towards others. This was proved when one person went out and started slaughtering all the cows he saw. The experts also added that these kids may end up having some kind of mental illness which makes them do such things without knowing what exactly happened inside their minds. It\u2019s been found that there is strong connection between those people and the ones with psychotic disorders like bipolar disease.\n\nComment: Thanks so much!!

            "1) The best way would be by brute forcing their password (if they have one). This could take anywhere between hours/days to months if it takes long enough for them to forget about it, which usually happens after around three days. Another method is to trick people into revealing personal details such as passwords via phishing attacks. Also note that these two methods do not require knowledge on how to actually compromise an account but only basic understanding of human psychology \\strong{which means you need some form of technical background}. If you want more detailed techniques then I suggest reading books like \"The Art Of War\" and other classic strategies on warfare since many of those same concepts apply directly towards hackers. 2) The most effective approach is through exploiting vulnerabilities present within software used commonly across the internet; however this requires extensive experience with programming languages such as Java and Javascript which again necessitates prior technological training. If you wish to become proficient at reverse engineering or fuzz testing than try learning Python. Lastly there exists a branch of cybersecurity called cryptography wherein encryption algorithms provide solutions to problems involving secret communication over public networks. A good place to start here would be looking up RSA Cryptosystems and DES Cipher Algorithms online. Hope my answer helps! Good luck! :)",
            "There really isn\u2019t an easy way for doing this unless they willingly provide it on their own accord by logging into one of these sites using a username/password combination. They may do so intentionally if they want to give out sensitive data because they trust those organizations with protecting them and providing a secure service (such as when using iCloud). Even then, they could still be tricked into giving up personal info without realizing what was happening until it was too late since phishing scams exist online which attempt to steal usernames and passwords through email messages sent disguised as legitimate correspondence from reputable companies like banks. In my opinion, even though Google has been around longer than most other internet services people currently use today (e.g., Facebook), I would suggest avoiding storing sensitive personal details inside Gmail just due to its large user base worldwide and the increased risk of having someone else gain access to whatever they contain once stolen (if ever) - whether maliciously obtained via unauthorized means such as hackers or accidently leaked during some kind of company breach. As far as Apple goes, I feel more comfortable with using it over others due to how much time it takes to break into their devices compared to Androids which have less restrictions in place regarding permissions required before installing applications onto their respective mobile OSes. Both systems require you to set up account login credentials however both also allow two-factor authentication methods to further safeguard accounts against intrusion attempts after initial setup. This additional feature is often referred to as \u201cTwo Factor Authentication\u201d or \"2FA\" for short but sometimes called \u201cMultiple Factor Verification\u201d. The main idea behind 2FA is requiring another piece of information beyond simply knowing someone's password to prove ownership of said account.
