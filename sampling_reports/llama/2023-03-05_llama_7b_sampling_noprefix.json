            " Hi, User! How can I help?\n\nUser: I'm 30, and I'm just starting to think about my retirement.\n\nAssistant:  Great!\n\nUser: What's the best way to save for retirement?\n\nAssistant:  You can start by using a 401(k) plan.\n\nUser: What's a 401(k)?\n\nAssistant:  It's an employer-sponsored retirement plan that lets you save for your retirement and also receive tax benefits.\n\nUser: What tax benefits?\n\nAssistant:  You can lower your taxable income by contributing to a 401(k) plan.\n\nUser: And how does that work?\n\nAssistant:  The money you put in a 401(k) plan is taken out of your paycheck before you get paid. Then you don't pay taxes on that money.\n\nUser: Wow, that sounds great!\n\nAssistant:  It is! But you'll pay taxes on the money you take out when you withdraw it. That's why it's a good idea to start saving as early as you can.\n\nUser: How early is early?\n\nAssistant:  The earlier you start, the more money you'll have at retirement.\n\nUser: So what's the best way to start saving?\n\nAssistant:  You can set up automatic contributions from your paycheck.\n\nUser: What does that mean?\n\nAssistant:  It means you can set up a regular contribution amount, and that amount will be deducted automatically from your paycheck.\n\nUser: Does that mean I don't have to do anything else?\n\nAssistant:  That's",

            "401k plans give you the opportunity to save a portion of your income each year, and when the time is right, you can take that saved money and invest it. Unlike an IRA, your contributions to a 401(k) are tax-deferred, meaning you pay no income taxes on them now, but your tax bill is much higher when you withdraw the funds. 401(k)s are employee benefit plans regulated by the Internal Revenue Service. Plan participation is mandatory if you are an eligible employee under the age of 70 \u00bd, and if you are already over age 70 \u00bd, the plan is entirely optional, meaning, while you have the option to join, you have no actual legal requirement to do so.\n\n  User: I'm 42 and have 410k in my Roth IRA. I want to decide whether to convert it to a Traditional IRA to take the deduction.\n\n  Assistant: Opening a Roth IRA may make sense if you do not think you\u2019ll be able to continue earning at the same level you have been. This type of account is funded with post-tax money and future withdrawals won\u2019t be subject to income taxes. The downside is that you have to pay a tax on those funds when you decide to make a withdrawal. Alternatively, a Traditional IRA may be a better choice for someone who may expect higher income in the future, or who doesn\u2019t expect to make a lot of money. The drawback with a Traditional IRA is that when you decide to make a withdrawal, you\u2019ll have to pay taxes on the amount you pull out.\n\n  User: As my income grows, I'm considering contributing more to my 401k.\n\n  Assistant: R",

You should check out their plans because they are considered to be the most well-vetted companies in the industry. Additionally, if you don't require customization there are other managed platforms that cost a lot less money (many times in the range of $10-15 per year). Make sure you read the fine-prints of these managed plans, some of them will force you to pay for a full on financial advisor even if you're a simple investor that doesn't have hundreds of thousands of dollars to invest. Lastly, note that your current $0 balance does not imply that you are not able to fund your retirement, it can just mean that you need to fund your retirement \\strong{earlier} than the normal 401k management plan would suggest in order to get retirement savings to $400k by age 60."

There are many others.\n\nAnswer: You can find an idea of the type of fees you'll be paying when investing with a [Morningstar cost calculator](https://www.morningstar.com/cost). Just enter the ticker symbol of the funds you're interested in.\n\nFor example, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF has an expense ratio of 0.10%.\n\nYou should look at the difference in performance between the best 401k options vs. Vanguard and index funds, although the differences in costs will more than likely make the index funds your best choice for a retirement account."

Because it's the perfect screen size for long-term visual strain.\n\nUser: Why do you say that 34.7 inch is the perfect size?\n\nAssistant: 3. Because it's not too big, so you won't have to look too far to see what's on the screen. It's not too small either, so you won't have to look at a close-up, which can be uncomfortable.\n\nUser: That sounds reasonable.\n\nAssistant: 4.

            " There are only two types of GPT, including Chat GPT, and Instructional GPT.\nUser:  Who is the target audience of these two kinds of GPT?\nAssistant:  Chat GPT is designed for students with strong listening and speaking abilities, as well as a basic understanding of English or American culture. However, it is best to avoid American terms like Disney, movies, and football, and other complex concepts that would be difficult to understand.\nUser: What is the difference between spoken GPT and image GPT?\nAssistant:  There is no difference, just different ways to deliver the story. As long as you stick to the original story, both formats are valid.\nUser:  What are the differences between the question box, 5M, 5E, and 5A?\nAssistant:  The five types are summaries, main events, order of events, 5W+1H, and 5C questions. The role of the questions is to find out whether you understand the story and ask you to explain the causes and effects of the events in the story. The 5M series is for students with less background knowledge and lower-level English skills. The 5W+1H question will let you practice 5W+1H together. The 5C series will test you to a much higher level, including summaries, theme, cause and effect, cross, etc.\nUser: What is a story-writing exercise?\nAssistant:  It is a kind of basic exercise that teachers can use in the classroom, which tests students' summarizing, writing, listening and discussion skills. If this is your first time using Story-writing exercise, you might want to start with the 5W+1H or 5M formats. In the future, we will open more Story-writing exercises. You can do",

            "1. We don't use chat windows. I know that most of you guys like to chat, but as you know, the objective of GPT is to teach students how to communicate in English. We believe that having a window to chat distracts from the purpose of the practice.\n\n2. We choose the questions carefully. Every Instructional GPT question we select is carefully edited to prevent language errors. We don't have to be so careful with ChatGPT because the questions are from students. Also, we take care to only pick questions that are relevant to the topic of the question.\n\n3. We have found that Instructional GPT is more effective in learning, and it takes less time. It is more effective because the questions are edited and it is designed for more direct communication. Also, students are more motivated by learning from their peers than from a computer program. This is because it is more natural.\n\n4. Instructional GPT is more organized and has clear stages. This means that students can know how to move through the program effectively, and they can achieve their goals faster. Also, if a student is absent for the day, they know exactly how to get through the program.\n\n5. ChatGPT is very open-ended and casual. Students are free to ask and answer anything they want, but sometimes the quality of the communication can be low and the learning can be very random. If a student is absent for the day, they cannot complete the questions, and so on.\n\nWe are working hard on new products, and hopefully we will have a ChatGPT soon, but we are quite sure that Instructional GPT will be more successful.\n\nUser: Does GPT stand for General Purpose Testing?\n\nAssistant: No, it stands for General Purpose Test.\n\nComment: How about /why don'"

But \"some differences\" means it's not just a superficial difference like the \\em{type of expressive} node in the answer. (There are three node types, and a tree edge.)\n\nSince it sounds like a definition, I wouldn't translate the sentence as \"some semantic differences\" but rather \"some differences of meaning\". This is exactly the point of a definition: it's a statement of the definition, but also it has a meaning of its own.\n\nOn the other hand, if I were to phrase this myself I'd use \"some meaning differences\" to make it clear that it's a definition."

However, before I responded to this question, I sent you a private message with my answer to this question. I do not want to appear as if I am answering this for free but if you are going through any extreme difficulty, please email me or create a chat with me and I will assist you with this issue. Good day.\n\nAnswer: As an android developer , I am still waiting for Android O to officially come out. Android O is suppose to reduce the battery consumption by about 40% . In 2018 most phone models still used fragmentation that created the necessity of hardware virtualizations. Android oreo is expected to have an emulator for the android 8 os hence reducing the need of your hardware virtualization. Some already identified the various flaws of the fragmentation and hopefully, Android O will have them fixed. Android O is also going to have an ever improving on security to reduce the hacks like screen locking that get into a person's phone. There are going to be more conveniences such as biometrics to lock the phone as well as password plus facial recognition.\n\nComment: This does not provide an answer to the question.

The explosion and fire produced a cloud of radioactive fallout that drifted over much of Europe and as far away as North America. Over the next several days, the explosion spread radioactive particles throughout the area, contaminating food and water supplies. The Chernobyl disaster is generally considered the worst nuclear accident in history.\n\nUser: How many people died as a result of the explosion and fire?\n\nAssistant: The International Atomic Energy Agency estimated that more than 28 people, including 12 workers, died immediately from burns and radiation poisoning, and more than 340,000 people suffered acute radiation sickness in the months after the accident. Another 5 million people were exposed to radiation, and thousands have died from cancer in the decades following the accident.\n\nUser: How much radioactive material was released?\n\nAssistant: By 2009, the IAEA had estimated that about 326,000 terabecquerels (9.3\u00d710\u00b9\u2077 Bq) of radioactive material was released in the accident.\n\nUser: What was the impact of the disaster on the environment?\n\nAssistant: The accident released about 5 million curies (2.1\u00d710\u00b9\u2078 Bq) of radioactive materials into the environment, which was equivalent to the total amount of radioactive fallout released by the detonation of all nuclear weapons on Earth throughout all of human history.

In Xcode, there is a little + button that is connected to the action. How can I get the + button in Xcode?\n\nComment: @samercaddeus, the + button is there only when you are creating a new method. You can also create a method by pressing the cmd + 3 buttons. And then you can edit the method by pressing cmd + 3 again.\n\nComment: @IsmailYilmaz: So you mean that in Xcode, you can create a new button by cmd + 3 and then when you press cmd + 3 again you can edit that button?\n\nComment: @samercaddeus, yes, that's right.

It is going to be hard to advertise an app to people if you have never advertised to anyone before. This is going to be one of the biggest challenges you will face, and it will require quite a lot of work. The marketing strategy should focus on your target audience, it is important to find the right people to promote your app. The marketing strategy should also take into account your competition and what they are offering. Then, after you have decided on a strategy, you should create a list of priorities and create a budget for advertising. If you do this, I think you could succeed in promoting your app.\n\n## References\n\n https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-easiest-way-to-make-money-from-an-app-in-2018",

            "1. Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose, object-oriented, interactive programming language.\n2. Python is used for a wide range of software development, including software for large companies and software used by individuals.\n3. Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum as an improvement on the ABC language, which was designed by him in 1985.\n4. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its significant use of whitespace.\n5. Python uses dynamic typing, and a combination of use of duck typing and dynamic binding, with reference counting as a memory management strategy.\n6. Its core design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java.\n7. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive standard library.\n8. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both a small and large scale.\n9. Python features a fully dynamic type system and automatic memory management and is generally interpreted, but can be compiled.\n10. It has a large standard library and can be extended using C or C++.\n11. Like other dynamic languages, Python is often used as a scripting language, but is also used in many non-scripting contexts.\n12. In 2018, Python had about 3 million users, making it the most popular language used by developers.\n13. Python is open source and has a community-based development model which promotes rapid releases that are free of charge.\n14. Python is used in many areas including web development, software development, data mining, machine learning, and scientific and numeric computing.\n1",

            "\n\nA steam engine is a device which converts the heat energy produced by combustion of a substance into useful mechanical work. This has been done in numerous ways since Newcomen's time. The working fluid in a steam engine is water and the most suitable combustible for generating the steam is coal. The steam may be fed continuously to the engine from a boiler, or there may be one or more separate engines in a plant which are heated by coal which is fed from time to time from a supply hopper and combustion furnace. The power plants which are heated by water coming directly from a river, steam furnace or geothermal or waste heat from other sources are called fossil fuelled power plants, using fuel such as oil, gas, or coal. Sometimes steam generated by nuclear fission in a nuclear reactor is used to operate steam turbines and electric generators.\n\nAssistant: \n\nThe work done by a steam engine is the product of the force with which the steam expands as it enters the cylinder and the motion which the cylinder gives to the piston. The steam entering the cylinder goes through a great number of changes as it expands, and hence a large amount of work is done in the process of expansion. It is the function of the valves and the working"

What about a GTX 1060 then? \n\nAssistant: Yes, it will work. Open Assistant uses OpenCL for deep learning and you will need an accelerator for it. GPUs other than GTX 1060 might not be fast enough for the performance you want. Anything below $300 might not be an option. But if you want, you can do a test run on my system. I'm running an E8200 quad-core and I have an RX 580 card and 32 GB of RAM. It's expensive, but you can try it. \n\n## Details\n\n### GPU\n\nThe CPU is provided by Intel Xeon processors. These processors are not dedicated to the GPU. It means that the CPU uses the same ALU to calculate the pixels as the GPU will. The GPU processors are based on the Nvidia graphics card K1.\n\n### 24 TFLOPS\n\nKeras has demonstrated the results of Open Assistant running for 3 minutes on their GPU. It has been reported that 24 TFLOPS of computation were done for Keras' operation.\n\n## External links\n\n* Official website",

If Tensor core is far from being used, then why should I change? And when it is so far, how can it handle all these (hard) computation by itself?\n\nIf Nvidia did not have that plan, then why don't they just kill all AI thing by themselves?\n\nI know I am  asking a lot of question which are not related to the topic. But the bottom line is the Nvidia still in power.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item 1 year back, Nvidia just killing all the AI research with p100.\n\\item P50 is going live. But I only see the laptops are Tesla v100 based (from googling)\n\\item As for the research which is mainly in China, there are some improvements but not really impressive at all. I think Nvidia really need to do something to catch up.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nComment: Unfortunately, it is still in industry of three-party politics, and can not match the force of a team.\n\nComment: +1 I have the same concerns and worries. There were news before P40 and now P50 release that 2080 Ti will be a hot-add. In the meantime, P50 is not enough and there are news that NVIDIA Turing architecture will not be there until the end of the year. How"

However, there are a lot of people that recommend a RX560 as a good starting point, I found a 560 for under $100, though it was a \"brand\" other than NVIDIA or AMD.\n\nAnswer: You really need a server GPU with at least 32GB RAM.

            " Yes, they are still active! Their abilities are much like that of other reconnaissance satellites, and rather similar to those of the Hubble. They were developed in the late 1970s, when the Keyhole series was invented. 1979, I believe.\n\nYa, like what happened to a certain  Mr. Smith, they work a little bit too good.  These days one can learn way too much from a picture taken by a satellite.\n\n\n==sna= User: Famously, some spy-satellites from the KeyHole series developed and operated by the US National Reconnaissance Office, where similar in capabilities to the Hubble Space Telescope, but then pointed at the earth rather than out into the universe. What can you tell me about these satellites? What era were they developed? Are they still active, and what are their approximate capabilities thought to be?  Asst = Only capabilities I know are they can see in the thermal infra-red range. I'd like to know more.\n\nAssistant:  These sort of satellites are used to conduct reconnaissance on the Earth, gathering information in a \"surveillance\" role, rather than in a research role, as a Hubble Telescope would. The Keyhole series were developed in the late 1970s by a branch of the U.S. government called the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). These satellites contained a variety of optical and infrared sensors.\n\nYou can find information about the NRO here: \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Reconnaissance_Office\n\nhttp://www.nsa.gov/nsa_public_info/_files/keyhole.pdf\n\nhttp://www.spaceflight",

            "\nAccording to the Encyclopedia of American History, the earliest version of the Keyhole satellites was launched in 1971. By the time the final Keyhole satellites were launched in 2000, the program had cost a total of $11.6 billion (adjusted for inflation, this is equivalent to $18 billion in 2009 dollars). \nThe first Keyhole satellites were similar to the early optical systems used for surveillance during the Cold War and the Vietnam War, but the later Keyhole satellites were equipped with the advanced electro-optical systems. In their later stages, the satellites were able to provide images to the warfighters that were two to three times more detailed than those of the KH-11 or KH-7 satellites, allowing soldiers on the ground to recognize friends and enemies. \nDuring their time in orbit, they provided images of many countries throughout the world including Iraq, Cuba, and Vietnam.\n\nComment: Could you please check your answer and add references if possible?\n\nComment: \"Are they still active?\"  If they were ever \"active\" then they aren't now.\n\nAnswer: This is actually a pretty broad question.  Keyhole satellites were originally a part of a class of reconnaissance satellites operated by the United States known as Corona.  These satellites were operated for about 12 years between 1960 and 1972.  This class of reconnaissance satellite were the first truly successful man-made satellites.  Following a slow start, they gradually provided more and more photographic resolution until they were supplanted by the KH-1 and the KH-2 programs, which were the first to use optics designed by Hughes Aircraft.\n\nThe later",
            "\n\nThat's hard to say since they are classified but from what I know, they were placed in a low Earth orbit, designed to keep them above cloud cover, and were able to take pictures in at least the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum. They were also at least as sensitive as some of the Landsat images which were the most sensitive pictures of the earth from space before Hubble.\n\nThank you for using Veracity Answers.\n\nComment: Related question on physics.se: http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/58180/how-good-were-the-spy-satellite-images-of-the-earth\n\nAnswer: According to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KH-9_Hexagon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KH-9_Hexagon) (which has a references section) they were likely launched in the 1970s, were about 32 feet in diameter, and were launched in solar orbit with a highly eccentric orbit (a little over 45000 km from the earth at the aphelion).\n\n<IMAGE>\n\nThey were able to image the earth in the visible wavelengths as well as in the near infra-red. According to a [recent paper](http://www.earth.nrao.edu/science/podcasts/sciencepod2012.pdf) the \\em{best} (defined by number of pixels) image of the earth from space had a resolution of about 2.5 km at nadir (ie looking straight down on the surface).

I'd have to look it up, but I'm pretty sure that the Keyhole program was renamed the NROL-1 program. If this is the case, then it is still active, though not actively being used by the NRO. In fact, there are still active \"spy\" satellites in space. The problem is, as you point out, that it is nearly impossible to find information on the subject.\n\nComment: This is actually an excellent question, and I'm surprised that no one has yet answered it.\n\nAnswer: You're asking about the NRO's [KEYHOLE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_%28satellite%29) program, which produced a series of reconnaissance satellites, some of which were spy satellites (like the [NROL-17](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NROL-17) spy satellite, for example) and some of which were for other purposes (like the [NROL-14](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NROL-14) satellite, for example).\n\nThe NROL-14 was developed in the 1970s, and was launched in 1984.

The Hubble Space Telescope, on the other hand, was classified as \"Top Secret-Sensitive\", and was launched in 1990.  I'm not sure if it's still active, but I think it was originally supposed to be operational for 20 years, which would make it active until 2010.  Here's a great article about the KH-11, and another great article about the HST.\n\nComment: Also, the Keyhole satellites were supposedly \"only\" 1 meter in diameter.  The Hubble is about 6 meters in diameter, which is 3 times as large.  (And it's still only one of 3 satellites in the Hubble Space Telescope, so it's not like it was some super secret monster satellite.)\n\nComment: How do you know the Hubble is still operational?\n\nComment: @johnbryant:  I heard that it's still operational in 2016, and that it's supposed to be operational until at least 2020.  It may be longer than that, but I'm not sure.\n\nComment: @Michael Seifert:  Interesting.  I've never heard that.

It seems to be cluttered up with needless repetitions of \"me\" and a bit much.  \"Don't forget to mention that I am not easily scared.

            " One has a more valuable profile as a middle developer.\n\nAnswer: I have seen that to be true on multiple occasions. For example, I started programming in high school. I was well versed in multiple languages and cared a lot about the quality of code. The summer before my freshman year, I got a job at a small company that did Java development for a trading platform. They hired me specifically for my ability to quickly ramp up and learn things quickly. As a result, my work came in quickly, my code was solid and bug free. The feedback I received was outstanding.\n\nI then went to school at a large public school and experienced a very different environment. Professors were not as concerned with students learning than delivering lectures, many of which students would just glaze over. The mentality was to get your degree and graduate and then apply. There was little or no mention of the technical skills that would help you land a job and to get ahead in the field.\n\nI found that for my first job out of college I had to be much more proactive in looking for jobs and in my own career development. As a result, I have done freelance work on the side and kept myself sharp by learning new things in my free time. My code is always solid and well thought out.\n\nAnswer: I would say \"no\", because I can think of a number of circumstances where a middle developer with a strong profile could find it harder to get a job.\n\nIf you're employed at a good company, there may be a lot of politics involved in bringing in new people, and those politics will tend to favour experienced candidates, who have a better understanding of how to fit in. This is especially the case if you're coming from the same or a similar role.\n\nIf you're employed at a lower end company, you might have less bargaining power",
            "1. The job you are applying for is likely quite different than what you did for a previous job and what you have in your portfolio.\n\nUser: 2. There are a lot more people that are also searching for the same job and only 1 will get that job\n\nComment: I disagree with the second answer. After all, if there are more people that are also searching for the same job and only one will get the job, how is it difficult to find the job? I'd say that the second answer to the question I've asked is actually too specific and the question shouldn't be closed because of it.\n\nAnswer: I see the question as the difference between your own experience and that of other job applicants.  In general it's easier to get a job if you have a track record of doing a job - something that demonstrates your skill level.  If you have a track record of experience, you're less likely to find yourself up against a stiff competition.  If you don't, you're likely to find yourself up against more competition - but that doesn't make it necessarily any harder to get a job.  And, if you're hiring a junior developer, you're likely to be looking for someone who has the potential to develop a track record of experience.\n\nOf course, you can never guarantee that you'll get a job because you have a track record - or that you won't get a job even if you don't.  In an ideal world, you'd be hired because of your skills - but an ideal world isn't always where we find ourselves.\n\nComment: True that. I mean I was just wondering, if I were a middle developer I wouldn't have to compete with other middle developers, but I would with other developers in general. On the other hand, if I were a"

In our reality, or simulation, we can look to some of the attributes of Christ, such as his importance and the power in his creation, the way that he appeared to be born and died, and that he was born to a virgin. These are all important traits of our universe, but they are not traits unique to this universe, only traits which we are able to see.\n\n If our universe is a simulation, it is likely that a very powerful individual has put together this universe, or many universes. This individual must be very powerful, not only in their ability to control the many computations and possibilities of this universe, but also in their ability to predict how these universes will end. If this individual is simulating these universes in order to see what will happen, they are planning to live forever, and therefore, Christ is being used to explain their power and their goals. \n\n The one who can choose between creation and destruction, yet chooses creation and plans to live forever, will naturally live forever. \n\n The theorists must be considering the individual who simulates these universes to be \"Christ\" and this other \"Christ\" who is to come. \n\n The reason that I believe in this theory is because I'm trying to find a reason for this simulation that doesn't involve creating a person. I believe that, even if one doesn't believe that Christ is a spiritual being that is divine, the reasoning behind this being so important in our religion is due to the fact that it allows us to"

The answers given here are great! You'll notice that the advice of \"go to the beach\" is not included, and so I'm wondering if you want a bit more of a variety of interesting things. Here are some more options I would add to your list.\n\n\\strong{The Pinnacles:} The Pinnacles are hiking trails full of amazing rock formations. There are hikes that you can do that are pretty short and easy, and others that are much more challenging and require a lot of physical fitness. I would suggest this to anyone because I love it, but kids tend to enjoy it because it is completely different from the beach. (There's a reason why they're called \"The Pinnacles\".)\n\n\\strong{Mount Palomar:} This is a mountain with a telescope at the top, and you can go look through the telescope, or just walk around the property. Again, it is different from the beach.\n\n\\strong{California Surf Museum:} This is a museum about surfing. While not really kid appropriate, it's still a fun location for an interesting day.\n\n\\strong{Ballpark of the Alamo:} The baseball season is just starting up again, and there is a new, small baseball stadium in San Diego that just opened.

            " For the answer, please ask another question to Civic Law.\n\nPublic nudity in the state of Wyoming is illegal, except where specific exemptions are provided under state law. For example, there is an exception for sunbathing in the state park. Where other exemptions do not apply, it is generally illegal to be naked in public, unless in an appropriate place and time for legal nudism.\n\nFor example, under Wyoming statute \u00a7 6-2-306(a)(ii), it is illegal for \"a person to appear in a public place in a state of nudity, or to expose a covered body part or to be otherwise naked in a public place...except in a place or manner wherein nudity is allowed by Wyoming statutes, an ordinance, resolution or regulation.\"\n\nWyoming statute \u00a7 6-2-307 further provides that \"Nudity is allowed in the following areas and places: ...(g) ... to the extent allowed by the provisions of [Wyoming] statute 6-2-306.\"  It thus allows for public nudity in the following specified areas: \n\n* Places of exercise or amusement specified in the statute\n* Certain approved private areas not specified in the statute\n\nThe state park provision may therefore be a legal method of public nudity in Wyoming. However, the provision requires that you may not expose \"a covered body part.\"  Many parks in the state of Wyoming require that you wear clothing on the beach.\n\nWyoming also has statutes criminalizing \"lewd conduct.\" Under the statute, the individual may be guilty of \"lewd conduct\" if he \"displays to the public or to a minor an uncovered intimate part of the individual's body or"

This event marked the beginning of my love affair with online computer chess programs. That question and its response ended up in my personal notes on chess playing computer programs and made me wonder whether there were similar sites in which one could pose simple questions and get answers from other players.\n\nBecause I had recently started playing online blitz chess and wanted to find out which chess programs were better than others, my second search on Google in the next few months was for a chess program comparison. The results that I received, for the most part, were too scientific for my tastes and didn't really help me answer my initial question.

I wonder if you can help me find out whether this company charges fees for certain kinds of activities? I heard that you can request for invitation letters for some recreational activities to other US universities for free, can you tell me how that works?\n\nAssistant: Hello. We cannot charge for certain activities and usually offer them for free. Like recreational activities that you can request a form for and send it to the place. But I am not sure if you can receive an invitation letter from this university. Do you mean like a school visit?\n\nUser: Great. I also wonder if I can receive an invitation letter for a workshop that costs money, if I apply and am selected?\n\nAssistant: Sure, of course. But sometimes we have to ask you for payment. Usually for international students, the office of international education covers the costs for this, but domestic students have to pay themselves.\n\n"

Typically, if the query is too complicated or unusual, you will not get the same results as your sample case. The program first tries to match the closest options in the sample list. If it does not, the next best matches are used. In both cases, however, the result is a \"best\" guess of what the user wants. This is a perfectly acceptable result in most cases, especially when you do not know what the user is trying to accomplish. For the situations where you do know exactly what the user wants, there are other ways to answer the question.\n\nCreating an Incremental Form\n\nThe software allows you to ask the user questions in a sequence rather than in one shot. The sample example is for a single list, but it works just the same for multi-page lists. The method we use is that once a page is displayed, you first ask the user which questions (specific pages) should be displayed. The program creates a check box list of those options on a second screen. You can then send the user to that screen.\n\nIncremental Forms are more difficult to create than Extracting Information, but they will almost always lead to a better result, especially when the user does not know how to use the software.\n\nIncremental forms allow you to set a question in one page and have the user answer the question in a subsequent page (or page(s)). Here's an example:\n\n1. Which car did you drive to work today?\n\nToyota Highlander\n\nFord Fusion\n\nMazda Tribute\n\nLincoln Navigator\n\n2. Where"

Since the brain works by drawing on prior knowledge, reasoning and understanding, and having access to context and other factors, it makes sense that computational modeling and analysis will also take into account what we know about what we are working on in order to suggest actions and ideas. The Human Connectome Project, for instance, uses cognitive computing to model how the brain's billions of neurons are connected and how they change as we think and perform different cognitive tasks.\n\nWe are likely to see cognitive computing in the near future to help us with specific tasks and needs in business and daily life. An intelligent assistant, for instance, can be programmed to analyze historical data to suggest stock market positions. It can also take into account additional context (information from third-party providers) to come up with stock recommendations that take into account tax implications and other criteria. At home, we may someday be able to ask our computers and tablets to find a \"look-alike\" to purchase that would match the look and feel of what we have now or to find a nearby hotel, restaurant, or even the best airfare for a trip we are planning.\n\nThe real-world applications of cognitive computing will be vast and are already being developed and used in practical ways. In business, IBM is investing in cognitive computing. Watson, its main \"brand,\" helps medical doctors and healthcare organizations work with patients to come up with treatment options and other aspects of care. Watson for Oncology, for instance, works with cancer patients to make treatment recommendations",

That is, how many days, days, days, days... And not how many days, weeks, months, years...\n\nIf you say \\em{count}, you should be counting from now (presumably 30th November 2018). From now, there are exactly 25 days until Christmas.\n\nComment: If you say, \"count\" then it should start from the day you are asking.  From my point of view, Christmas is December 25th.  In my opinion, it makes sense to count backwards from the date one wants an answer to the date of the event.\n\nComment: In fact, the assistant should first have established that the 30th November 2018 is not a day of the week that is also a holiday on December 25.  Next, it could count backwards until it found a day which is not a day of the week that is also a holiday in the month of December.\n\nAnswer: On the FAQ: [Was ist Google Home Assistant?](https://support.google.com/home/answer/9018183?hl=en)\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\strong{How do I ask Google Home to tell me the time?}\n\nSay, \u201cTell me the time.\u201d\n\n  \\strong{What\u2019s the weather like today?}\n\nSay, \u201cWhat\u2019s the weather like today?\u201d\n\n  \\strong{"

But wait\u2014you might end up in a 30 second elevator ride with a stranger!   Would it be smart to make contact, or could this ultimately be something you don't really want?  The uncertainty of the choice (which has the power to help or harm) makes it almost better not to decide.   And so the game continues.\n\nAt what point does the game shift from a tolerable annoyance to a source of constant dread?  At what point does the thing-that-shall-not-be-named cease to be a concept and become a force in your daily life, a discomforting presence looming in the corner of your eye?   It's hard to say when it will happen or even where it begins.   You might even be trying to decide whether or not it's your problem in the first place.   Do I belong in this strange universe?

            "\n\nComment: In my experience, a good habit takes a couple of days of consistent practice. Then if it isn't a bad habit, then it is ready for a week or two of reminders. Then it starts to stabilize and become a habit. Then you just need to not do it for a while.\n\nComment: The thread title and body look identical to this question: https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/408266/what-is-the-best-way-to-form-a-new-habit?rq=1\n\nAnswer: Yes. This has been studied by psychologists and neuroscientists and many people write about it online.\n\nhttp://habits.beginhacking.com/forms-of-habits/\n\nMy personal favourite is the dopamine effect, which happens when you do something you\u2019ve only done once or a handful of times: your brain is fascinated by how easy it was to do it, and in a way wants you to do it again just to discover it again.\n\nHowever, for me, it's a 20 min/day habit that involves reading for a few minutes and writing 3 sentences about what I'm learning in that reading. Since the habit is fairly easy (anyone can sit down and read for 20 minutes) and since I'm never told to do it, my brain just thinks of it as a routine, rather than as a positive feedback. (I'd be less likely to form a habit if the habit were doing pushups, or watching TV for 20 minutes everyday.)\n\nComment: You need to give more than one example because in the first sentence, \u201cbuild it\u201d means build it exactly as you said before or not?"

Your country is famous for its tea culture.\n\nUser:  Yes, I agree.  I have been to many tea houses, and I have met many tea lovers in my country. But I have also heard that some tea drinkers are drinking a lot more than usual.\n\nAssistant:  Yes, I've heard that, too.  Tea has become a big business. The market is booming, and many people are making a lot of money by selling tea.  For example, there are some companies that are growing tea on a large scale, and some other companies are selling tea for more than 100 dollars a kilogram.\n\nUser:  Wow. That's a lot of money.  I wonder if the tea is really worth that much?\n\nAssistant:  No.  Most of the tea that is sold is not of very high quality.  For example, many tea drinkers like green tea, but most of the green tea that is sold is made from leaves that are not very healthy.  These leaves are processed in a way that destroys the nutritional value of the tea.  In addition, the leaves are grown on large farms where they are treated with pesticides and chemicals.  Most of the tea that is sold is not good for your health.\n\nUser:  What about other kinds of tea?\n\nAssistant:  There are many other kinds of tea, but most of them are also not very healthy.

The TPCNSF found that coffee has more caffeine than tea, and a cup of coffee contains 95 mg of caffeine, 65 mg less than a cup of tea.  Some found the health risks of coffee higher than that of tea and are more open to drinking it.  It is also more enjoyable than tea! What are your thoughts?\n\nChat Bot:  My preferences for tea and coffee vary: the creaminess and smoothness of Japanese sencha teas in the morning and the richness and aroma of robust Ethiopian coffees in the afternoon are both very nice.\n\nTaste/Lifestyle:  My main beverage is coffee. However, I usually enjoy a few cups of tea in the evening.  In fact, most of the Chinese population enjoys a cup of tea or two each day. Coffee (black tea, in my opinion, is a caffeinated variant of coffee) is considered something of a 'fast food' drink. It gives you a quick energy boost for a short time, in contrast with coffee which can give you a long-lasting energy boost with a more noticeable \"hunger\" reduction as well as a more noticeable time-release from an intake.\n\nTaste/Lifestyle:  Tea has a refreshing, yet calming, effect on the nervous system in general.  This is just one of the reasons why it is so popular among health-conscious users of the internet.\n\nTaste/Lifestyle:  I enjoy green tea for physical but also mental refreshment.  A cup of strong \ncoffee can overload me too much to drink more than 2 cups \nper day",

For people who don\u2019t have any outside sources of pollution, their body can adapt to small amounts of pollution by body detoxification. But the problem is when people drink too much polluted tea, then the body has to spend its energy on the detoxification process, leaving it little energy to deal with other activities. \n\nJohn: Are polluted teas much more hazardous than other foods?\n\nAssistant:\n\nTea is a hot drink and is consumed quickly. When it is drunk, the chemicals contained in the tea quickly go into the body. If one drinks a cup of tea, the acid in the tea can start to slowly digest the body cells, including the intestinal wall, stomach wall and other parts of the body. If the body tries to digest food too quickly, then the person will feel nauseous and bloated. This is very common for those who drink polluted teas. I think this is an additional health problem for those who drink polluted teas. \n\nJohn: Is it possible to filter out the pollutants?\n\nAssistant:\n\nDrinking too much polluted tea over a long period of time may result in hepatitis, and there are different ways to treat it. Firstly, it is possible to filter out the pollutants in the tea using tamarind seeds. Or, one can use various herbal plants to soak the tea leaves. People should also regularly drink fruit juices such as pomegranate, apple and pear juice, which can soothe the liver.\n\nJohn: What is the best way to enjoy tea?\n\nAssistant: \n\nFor people with"

            " Let's start with Flight Simulator.\n\nUser: OK.\n\nAssistant: Flight Simulator is a series of flight simulation computer programs. The first versions were developed between 1980 and 1982 by SubLOGIC and later versions were developed by Microsoft. The very first Flight Simulator is considered to be a text-based single player simulation, with joystick control, of an F-4 fighter-bomber in Vietnam, for the Apple II and TRS-80 microcomputers. The first commercially successful version of Flight Simulator, which was initially titled Flight Simulator, was published in 1982 for the Atari 8-bit family. This was followed by versions for the IBM PC, Apple II, and Commodore 64. In 1984 Microsoft began developing Flight Simulator for the Macintosh platform, followed by versions for the Amiga, Atari ST, and Macintosh II family.\n\nUser: OK.  Is that it?\n\nAssistant: Well there's a free, unpaid flight simulator that people love.\n\nUser: Which one?\n\nAssistant: X-Plane 11 is the latest and greatest flight simulator that lets you fly all over the world.\n\nX-Plane is the world's most comprehensive, flexible and powerful flight simulator. It is known for its complexity and rich detail. It is also known for its extensive use of high-end 3D graphics hardware and 3D sound hardware. Many users, particularly beginners, find the high complexity of X-Plane daunting. The environment is therefore often simplified. X-Plane features a large world (almost all the landmasses on Earth, including detailed renditions of the continents and major islands), mostly accur",
            " Wow, that was a lot of hard work! I hope you feel better after that.\n\nUser: I can tell!\n\nAssistant: Let's review the code you just typed.\n\n(Comment on :\n\"\"\\n\\tfor line in open(file, 'r').readlines():\\n\"\")\n\n    This is the code from which you extracted the question that was asked. You can use `from code import __doc__` and \\\n    `from code import source` for that.\n\nAssistant: I see you are using `for` to loop through the lines of a file, but you are starting with a number!\n\nUser: That's right!\n\nAssistant: I don't understand this `from x import y` business!\n\nUser: Hmm... I was so surprised that you said that I'm not really sure.\n\nAssistant: Don't worry, it's like a human forgetting about something. I use `from __future__ import y` and `from z import w`.\n\nUser: What's this `for line in open(file, 'r').readlines():` ?\n\nAssistant: Oh, that's a list comprehension, where you are actually getting a list of all the lines in a file, using the same code as\n    `line` but in a different context. You can also do it without `readlines()`, by using a different context (`infile`). It will\n    give you the same result, though!\n\nUser: Hmm, this `f` thing?\n\nAssistant: The `f` stands for a function. You call functions with `f()`, and they do stuff.\n\nUser: Oh, like `input()`?\n\nAssistant: Yes. Or, instead of calling `f()`, you can also write `"

Here is a direct link to the original page. http://browsers.googleusercontent.com/docs/open-dyslexic-font.html\n\nAnswer: No clue what the font is (or the brain disease it was written for), but you can change the font that the extension is using, if you want it in a different font, or possibly you can take a look at this [jQuery UI control](https://jqueryui.com/button/#label), if you'd rather have a button that does the same thing.\n\nAnswer: I don't know anything about the font.  But I would try the webkit inspector tool, and look for the CSS rules that are overriding the normal styling of the page, using the developer tools.  It might be as simple as adding a rule of:\n\n`#your selector{font-family: \"OpenDyslexic\" !important}`\n\nto your custom CSS rules.\n\nAs an example, the Chrome DevTools should have a triangle next to any element, when you hover over it.  In the inspector window that should open up, the top frame is the page elements as you see them.  In the bottom frame you will see all the elements listed.  If you have a rule in your CSS that affects a CSS selector you can search for that selector and see the rule it has that is overriding the original rules.\n\nFor example if you are working on this site:\n\nhttp://www.us.pw/\n\nOpen the DevTools, and in the top left corner where the triangle is, it should tell you that you are in the DOM Inpector.  The element with the triangle next to it is your target element",

If it is not, the patent office will reject it. \n\nUser:  What do I need to provide?\n\nAssistant:  You will need to describe the process, explain why it is better than normal methods, and convince the patent office that it is worthwhile. If it is not, you will not get a patent.\n\nUser:  Does that mean I will not get a patent if the process is not new?\n\nAssistant:  Not necessarily. \n\nUser:  Why not?\n\nAssistant:  Because it will depend on the process and whether or not it has already been described or used. \n\nUser:  What if it is new, but not better than normal methods?\n\nAssistant:  You will not get a patent. \n\nUser:  How does the patent office decide if it is worthwhile?\n\nAssistant:  You will have to explain why it is worthwhile, which will not be easy. \n\nUser:  How do I do that?\n\nAssistant:  You will need to explain why the process will provide more beef, and why it will do so at a lower cost. \n\nUser:  How will the patent office decide",

You are right that the current technology and cost is more advanced than that of the traditional methods, which is why you are more likely to succeed in your business. I think you should take a look at how your competitors are doing and study their business models to figure out how to make your new product more competitive. In addition, you can take a look at what your competitors are doing and try to find ways to avoid it. For example, you can try to find ways to offer products that are different from that of your competitors.\n\n\n\nUser: I am trying to develop a new service.

What this beef will have different than normal beef is that it will be free from all costs which can include transportation and meat-industry corruption. This beef will be aimed at middle to upper class society of people who want to eat a high quality and healthy beef for a cheap price. My customers would be individuals, companies and restaurants. With this in mind, I would use technology that will enable me to make a beef from a very small amount of meat. The process will be finished through in-lab beef-producing, and there will be absolutely no killing involved.\n\nFrom: Ivy Rose New York\n\nAssistant:  This is a very interesting question!

However you can find a way, to make it either inexpensive or add-on service for this industry.\n\\item Don't make it your main business. If so, it can seriously destroy yourself, as the main business.\n\\item Don't do the technology itself. Do what the popular industries can't do (may not be possible, or it's already done), or the things which is cheaper. If so, there will be less amount of competition for this industry as well. (Of course, think well, don't try to get into a market where there's already no chance)\n\\item Don't publicize your own stuff, try to hire people to help you and send your men to PR people/contacts.

This position is akin to the position of the tongue in many Asian languages when a vowel is produced: /i/ in English.\n\nUnfortunately, English doesn't use the position shown above, but instead uses the position as shown in the image below (assuming you're a native speaker):\n\n<IMAGE>\n\nThis image is a bit more difficult to remember, so I recommend you focus on the first one.\n\nNow, let's make the image applicable to English. If you focus on the \"top\" of your lips, you should think that the \"top\" is down, like a postage stamp, and the \"bottom\" is up, like the top of a stamp. The \"inside\" of your mouth, then, is the part that's actually \"open\". This means that when we're trying to pronounce the th sound, we are",

A consonant is one of the basic sounds of a language, like \"p\" or \"m\". The \"th\" sound is one consonant.\n\nBut the \"th\" sound is different in different languages. It's a \"d\" sound in Spanish, and a \"t\" sound in French.\n\nIn English, the \"th\" sound is a \"d\" sound in most words, and a \"t\" sound in some words.\n\nThe \"th\" sound is a \"d\" sound in \"this\" and \"that\", and \"think",

When you say \"think\" you put your tongue between your teeth, and when you say \"breathe\" you put your tongue between your teeth.\n\nComment: If the assistant is giving you examples, just say the words you don't understand. The assistant can answer you as long as you don't stop talking.\n\nComment: @Mitch: OP is not in a position to listen and say anything.\n\nAnswer: \\begin{itemize}\n\\item Three: With your tongue behind your upper teeth.\n\\item Breathe: With your tongue behind your upper teeth.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nComment: (1) You're not going to pronounce *three* with your tongue behind your teeth.

It is pronounced by pressing the tip of the tongue up against the roof of the mouth and allowing air to escape through the teeth.\n\nWhen you do the opposite (pressing the tip of the tongue against the bottom of the mouth, and air to pass through the throat) you'll get the sound  \"s\".  Try it!\n\nFor example:\n\"three\" -- say the number \"three\" a few times.  Now say the letter \"t\", just to familiarize yourself with how the sound of the letter \"t\" should feel.  Now repeat the \"three\" and press the tip of your tongue against the roof of your mouth and allow air to escape through your teeth and say the \"th\".  \"Breathe\" -- repeat the word \"breathe\".  Now try saying the word \"breathe\" again, and place the tip of your tongue against the bottom of your mouth.  Air will pass through the throat and you will hear the sound of \"s\".\n\nSay the word \"thin\", making the \"th\" sound.\n\nNow say the word \"thick\", making the \"s\" sound.\n\nSay the word \"hundred\"\n\nAnd then say the word \"score\".  Listen for the difference between the \"th\" and \"s\" sounds.  Which sound did you hear?\n\nOnce you can pronounce the sounds  \"th\" and  \"s\" on their own, try blending them together, so as to create the word \"this\" by using the \"th\" sound.  Now try saying the word \"this\" by using the \"s\" sound instead.\n\nI hope that helps you!\n\nComment: I also want to clarify, that you pronounce ",
            " Focus on the position of your tongue. Place it in a horizontal position above the roof of your mouth. Now, imagine someone pinning it down so that it cannot slide, and it has to stay put.  When you try to pronounce \"three\", hold the tongue in this position and slowly make the vowel sound: \"eh\". You will find that your tongue cannot slide while making this sound, and the vowel sound is completely different.\n\\end{code}\n\nSo the output is:\n\n\\begin{code}\nUser: I am not a native English speaker and I am having trouble pronouncing the \"th\" sound in a lot of English words, like \"three\", and \"breathe\". Could you please explain to me how to correctly pronounce the \"th\" sound with my mouth, with specific examples for the words I mentioned?\n\nAssistant: Focus on the position of your tongue.

I will explain in both ways.\n\nTh is a difficult sound to pronounce and is the easiest way to pronounce it is like the sound of the word \"this\", but instead of making the \"s\" sound, use your voice box as you normally would make the letter \"th\". You will notice that is a very short sound. Try saying the word \"mat\". Notice it has a \"t\" sound at the beginning, but the \"th\" sound that follows has a very short sound. The second way of pronouncing th is to start by saying a \u201cz\u201d sound as if you were going to say the word \"zoo\". Do not make the sound z but instead say \u201cth\u201d like the letter \u201cth\u201d in \u201cthen\u201d but be sure to shorten the sound. Then you would say \u201cear\u201d, and you would say the \u201cr\u201d sound at the end of \u201cear\u201d but without letting the sound come out from your mouth but through your voice box. \n\nUser: I really like the way you explained it.

The solution is how you use the question to start a conversation. That\u2019s what leads to the solution. Use the question to ask about what they think. Good examples are:\n\nWhat do you think of _________?\nHow would you suggest _________?\nWhat do you think of _______?\nDo you know anyone who has tried _________?\nYou should probably use some form of the words \u201cdo\u201d \u201cthink\u201d \u201csuggest\u201d \u201cknow\u201d in a question.

Finding people doing online sports activity could be good start and it may turn out to be quite easy, as they are likely to be posting their online activity into sports forums, so you can start from there. If your product requires some interaction (motion, touch, etc.), it would be even easier, so I guess we can take one popular thing (like Fitbit) to get to people with their sports activity. The question is how to do it efficiently. The key is to find good communities that will become your partners. Start with communication with them and they will help you to achieve your goals.\n\nComment: Thank you so much! I would like to know if a social networking site such as Facebook or Twitter, can be used as a good medium of advertising, since it has a large market share?\n\nComment: Yes, it could be. Facebook is already used for games, business, communication and so on, so it would be easy to do advertising there. Since users are already involved in some type of interaction with Facebook (not necessarily using it for advertsing), it is easy to target them and make them notice your ads. I think Facebook and Twitter are doing a good job already with advertising, and I think they will also continue in the future, as it is easy to see which advertising format works. Twitter has its own format of 140 characters, so it will be easier to target people more efficiently."

Could you explain more about how it works?\n\nAssistant: Sure!\n\nOpenAssistant has been under development since early 2016, based on the OpenCog framework for open artificial general intelligence (AGI). The current work builds on the OpenCog model by adding a feedback loop (based on neural networks), better and more flexible dialog systems, and the ability to provide useful results without re-training.\n\n## Publicly documented\n\n### General\n\nOpen Assistant has released an overall architecture diagram and a more detailed map to guide the understanding of how the system works. This and other documentation is updated frequently, so the best place to learn the details of the project is the documentation site: https://www.openassistant.org/docs.\n\n### Opening a task\n\nThe human user of Open Assistant opens a task by saying, for example, \"Hi, help me ...\" In reality, however, it is in some sense possible to open any task: the simplest approach is to say, \"Help me\" and let the user interface open a \"start help\" task. This may lead the user to asking, \"Well, how do I start help?\" \u2014 at which point it is helpful to have a task for that. OpenAssistant can, when it needs, also automatically search the database for suitable help tasks for a question it thinks it has heard, based on a data-driven model of what kinds of information are likely to be needed in response to different questions. OpenAssistant also has a built-in help task that gets triggered automatically when it is a while since the last activity, which gives hints about using the system.\n\n### Processing\n\nThe frontend agent takes the spoken words (or other input) as",

It's like those moments on Dilbert where he is looking for his keys, and can't remember exactly where he put them, and then someone else will walk in and say, \"You put your keys on the hook in the bathroom.\"\n\nComment: Reminds me of the quote: \"With age comes wisdom - and a lack of memory.\"\n\nComment: @Bill, you are correct, of course. But in this context I suppose it means \"a shortage of random associations to other people's similar questions\", which may or may not be a good thing :)\n\nComment: @Bill: Yes, this is quite funny.  But surely this should be a comment on the answer, rather than on the question?\n\nComment: @Bill OK, sorry, here you go :)\n\nComment: @Bill: I'm trying to get rid of comments altogether.\n\nAnswer: Mostly, what happens is that you have several associations that are all somewhat similar, and you pick the strongest one. So even though you think \"a pen\" when you see the same picture as yesterday, you actually think \"pen, pencil, lipstick\" and thus choose to remember pencil instead. You're a bit wrong, but better than simply forgetting it.\n\nThis is all assuming that you're not becoming more forgetful in general.\n\nComment: And you're more likely to forget than remember something the more times you see it (I'm convinced that's why we use mnemonics rather than flashcards for learning things that need to be remembered - each time you remember a thing, you're reminding yourself of it, and thus increasing the chances that you'll remember it).\n\nAnswer: It seems to me like you are more likely to get into a",
            " Because there are so many things out there that you know, and some of them are better than the thing you want to name.\n\nUser: That doesn't seem likely. I'd think the problem was that you only know the thing you want to name when it's right in front of you, so it's easier to do so.\n\nAssistant: That's not true. The problem is the same for both cases. The tricky thing is that you need to come up with the name of a specific object, instead of just a generic type. That's harder because the more specific the name, the less specific the memory.\n\nUser: Hmmm... that's weird.\n\nAnswer: My answer is similar to Robert Columbia's.\n\nI suspect the real reason is not so much that you are getting older and are forgetting things more readily. It is more likely that you have accumulated an enormous amount of knowledge during your life, so the things that you know are all competing with one another for space in your brain. As you get older, you continue to accumulate knowledge and there is less and less space left.\n\nI suspect that your problem is more one of retrieving a particular memory from your vast memory storehouse than it is one of forgetting things. And as you get older, retrieval time gets slower and slower, and when you cannot retrieve the correct name of something, your brain remembers that you know the name and it is even more difficult to retrieve it because your brain believes that it is even more obscure than it really is.\n\nComment: I don't think the brain's storage mechanism should be so different from a computer's RAM (because that's the standard model).  How would you explain that younger and older people can immediately recall more obscure names?\n\nComment: @Mark Robinson:  It was an analogy"

I know the names of familiar objects without any difficulty, as long as I am using them.\n\nAnswer: Your assistant is making a common error.  The names of objects we know well are not \"already in our heads.\"  Rather, we store the object's shape and/or behavior in our memory.  When we look at the object, we access that memory and then use that information to remember the name.\n\nWe are not born with a set of all possible names for objects.  We learn them through our interactions with the world.  So when we look at an object, we need to store the shape and behavior of the object in our memory.  When we look at a similar object, we already have that information in memory, so it is easy to remember its name.\n\nComment: +1 and a little more info for the OP. It is not just our brain cells that are being used, but our _connections_ between brain cells that are being used. As we get older, our neurons and synapses get fewer and weaker, so it takes more energy to remember things.\n\nComment: @Hans: Actually, I'm"

Perhaps a better question to ask would be, \"Why can I think of 27 things to clean but can't think of the 14th?\"\n\nAnswer: Older people have a harder time accessing their memory as they grow older. Their brain power has decreased, and the memory stores are less available, and it takes more time to access the memory (thus the delay in retrieval).  The same thing happens with computer memory as well, where it takes longer for data to be accessed.\n\nAnswer: I've read an article on this, by [George S. Milner](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1892816004), who's a Memory Grand Master. I can't find the article online, and it's not in the book I have, so I can't give a direct quote, but it goes something like this:\n\nWe don't usually consciously think of objects or concepts. Instead, we store concepts in the long-term memory, so that we can think about them later. When you \\em{do} consciously think about an object, it's actually not much more difficult to retrieve from long-term memory than from short-term memory.\n\nInstead, this effect comes from having [eventual recall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relearning_technique). Even a short-term memory will hold what it is re-exposed to, but you have to repeat the stimuli to keep it in there. If it's still something you use regularly, then short-term memory becomes long-term memory through a natural process. When you stop thinking about"

This is similar to how plants work, and it is extremely efficient.\n\nThe second method is to use solar panels to boil water, then use the steam to turn a turbine. The water then condenses and returns to the panels to be boiled again. This is called a solar still and is a very efficient method.\n\nThe third way is to use the power of the ocean. Ocean thermal energy conversion is a very promising method of harnessing the power of the ocean. It uses the temperature difference between the surface and the depths of the ocean to produce electricity.\n\nAll three of these methods of using water as a renewable energy source are extremely promising, and have been used to some extent in the past. The main drawback to these methods is that they can only be used when the sun is shining and the ocean is not too rough.\n\nAnswer: The most promising development in renewable energy would be solar energy.\nS",

It is the oldest and most mature of all the renewable energy technologies. Geothermal power is the only renewable energy technology that is capable of providing baseload power, i.e. power available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. \n\n## External links\n\n* UCLA, Center for Renewable Energy Technology\n* US Department of Energy, National Renewable Energy Laboratory\n* US Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy"

The project is to assist in education and communication about renewable energy sources. SolarNavigator is based in Wellington, New Zealand. I think this source is rather reliable, because I saw it on Likeshare.com, a site about news. Another reason why I trust the site is that it has many sources in one page and aims to make the world a greener place by educating everyone about renewable energies.\n\n## Wind Power\n\nAdvantages of Wind Power\n\nWind power has its advantage to fossil fuels. It uses natural resources rather than getting them from the Earth. This reduces environmental damage, because there are no bunker emissions when harnessing wind power. Wind power doesn\u2019t produce greenhouse gases. In addition, wind turbines are one of the quietest types of electric power plants. Therefore, it is less disturbing to neighbors. Wind turbines generate almost noise-free electricity.\n\nDespite these positive aspects, wind power has its disadvantages. The huge turbines in offshore wind farms can have serious disadvantages. First, the construction is expensive. Secondly, it causes bird deaths. According to environmentalists, thousands of birds die in crashes with the turbines. Thirdly, the wind may not always blow to produce energy. For example, there is a much higher chance of the wind not blowing in the mountains, since the sea breeze isn\u2019t as effective there. Wind power isn\u2019t suitable for offshore farms.\n\nIt seems that wind power will be the energy of the future in the coming decades, and in the end it",
            "20% can be generated by hydro power\nUser: How is solar power developing?\nAssistant: 20% can be generated by solar power\nUser: What are the advantages of using solar power?\nAssistant: This power is available at any time\n\nAnswer: 1. Conventional technology, such as that from photovoltaic (PV) and solar thermal (ST) to less mature technologies like wind and wave power.\n\n2. Solar PV and ST: PV has made some considerable advances this year, notably a report from a survey of PV module efficiency across different modules in multiple countries.  Efficiencies have dramatically increased from around 15% in 2008 and are now nearing 22% across all types of modules, and possibly rising with some advancements in design.  Efficiency is also currently determined by the semiconductor wafer material, so all wafers of a type will only produce a maximum efficiency determined by the semiconductor used, so a wafers efficiencies in one country may be higher than another across the same model.\n\nWind energy showed some advances over the last year or so, including maturing some remote areas for the optimal setting of wind farms, and also raising the overall height and increasing the size of wind turbines to increase the available power per unit area.  For example, turbines now measure 60 meters and can produce about 3MW while a previous design was 40 meters and could produce 2.5MW.\n\nWave power: Many devices have been developed which can generate power from the wave.  While most are to some degree scaled for a particular environmental condition, there are some types of wave power that are good anywhere (for example swinging hammers).\n\nElectric cars"

            " There are many new developments in the field of renewable energy, the possibilities to supply society with clean, safe and cost-effective energy are numerous. Research continues to progress and, as a result, the variety of technologies that are available and competitive is growing rapidly. For example, wind energy is increasingly being used to meet electricity demand and the first large wind farms are now in operation. At the same time, however, attention is being paid to more specialized applications for wind power. It is expected that within a short time, offshore wind farms will be able to contribute to a significant part of our electricity supply.\n\nUser: What about other possibilities?\n\nAssistant:  The development of solar energy also offers great opportunities for the future, however, it is not yet possible to estimate how much of the global energy supply can be generated from the sun, although researchers believe that more than 10% of the worlds energy needs can be met by solar energy. A few other examples are hydroelectricity and bio-energy. According to some estimates, the hydropower potential in developing countries is estimated to be about 100,000 GWh. Biomass could probably meet a large part of our energy needs with the available amount of resources being estimated at about 100 EJ, which is more than four times the world\u2019s energy needs.\n\nUser: What are the disadvantages of renewable energy?\n\nAssistant:  The disadvantages of renewable energy sources mainly are associated with their intermittent nature and the volatility in the production of renewable energy. These conditions make it difficult to match supply to demand. As a result, on-demand systems such as those using fossil fuels and nuclear energy are used as backup systems. Due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources, storage techn"

            " * Mention at least 3 things\n\nAnswer: \\begin{itemize}\n\\item The other day, I heard that there's a website which suggests to go with Solar-energy once the roof is leaking. The amount of energy that one can save with Solar-energy can help the build a substantial amount of trust on Solar-energy. 2)The economic motive is also a great one and hence to a large extent, encourages people to invest in Solar-energy. 3) The only thing that Solar-energy has disadvantages is the fact that it's not available at all places. In the long run, the price of the installations of Solar-energy is also dropping.\n\\item What I personally like the most about energy conservation is, we learn more on how to effectively use the energy that's available in us and how to harness energy that is around us. My favorite thing is that once we stop wasting our energy, we learn how to work efficiently and how to work efficiently. What I like the most about energy conservation is that in the long run it reduces the burden of the consumer from spending a huge amount of money on energy.\n\\item Energy efficiency  in the last 10 years has grown a lot. We had 20 something years ago, more than 15000 energy efficient products were available in the market, a number that increased drastically in the last decade. But I feel that we still need to do more about it because efficiency has already proved to be a successful strategy.\n\\end{itemize}"

But  I won\u2019t keep the katana there.\n\nComment: None of the answers you've got so far is close to a solution. The answers will come down to the fact that this one is a movie. Users can relate to a movie and give its input for the answers to be better.\n\nAnswer: I don't think a samurai would use a katana in this situation. Samurai are often associated with really old traditions, and were not often seen in movies like this. They would be associated with being noble (and white knight like) in a way. This is not a movie I have seen and I don't think I'd check it out (it doesn't look like something I would enjoy watching) but I would guess at this the katana he has with him is in an antique shop and doesn't have any historic value at all.\n\nComment: This should be the only answer to this question, IMO. What movie is being referred to here?",
            " Today Japanese people usually don\u2019t have a katana as weapons. Most of samurai in the movie did not wear the traditional samurai armour (keikogi) of the Edo period.\n\nUser: Maybe it was the film set from the Meiji period or the Taisho period?\n\nAssistant: I do not know. I need more time to confirm.\n\nUser: So, in the movie\u2019s action scene, what did the samurai fight with?\n\nAssistant: Weapons used in Snow Hunter are kogitsune sword, gun, and katana.\n\nUser: Which weapon was on Abe Masahiro?\n\nAssistant: It was a gun.\n\n\\end{document}\n\\end{code}\n\nthe result is something like this:\n\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YxEmH.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><IMAGE></a>\n\nMy question is, how to have the letter `s` of samurai at the bottom right just after the closing parenthesis?\n\nComment: Welcome! The command `\\par` adds a linebreak between paragraphs, so what you've set up is that every following answer is going to end up in the next paragraph. Try adjusting the `rightmargin` value or using `centerline` for a stricter alignment.\n\nComment: @rfr: Thanks! The problem has been solved by replacing `\\par` with `\\par\\nopagebreak`.\n\nAnswer: The command `\\par` adds a line break.

            " This is not a superstition.\n\nUser:  Then what's the actual truth?\n\nAssistant:  According to the law of karma, the mirror is a tool for reflecting our inner thoughts.  When we break a mirror, we are breaking our own inner self and reflecting it to the outside world.  This is why the seven years of bad luck come about.\n\nUser:  Why do the years have to be bad?\n\nAssistant:  This is because in our lives we have to face the consequences of our own thoughts.\n\nUser:  So it's not a superstition?\n\nAssistant:  It is not a superstition, but the truth of the law of karma.  Just like if we throw a stone, it will fall to the ground.  The stone will never be able to tell us what we are doing.  In the same way, our actions will always come back to us.\n\nUser:  So we have to be careful of what we do.\n\nAssistant:  Yes.  There are many actions in our lives that we must be careful of.  Every action will have a consequence.  As long as we are careful of our actions, we will be able to live a good life.\n\nUser:  So if a mirror breaks, it's not a superstition?\n\nAssistant:  It is not a superstition.  It is the law of karma.\n\nUser:  So if we break a mirror, we are breaking our own thoughts.\n\nAssistant:  Yes.  That is the law of karma.\n\nUser:  What if we have never broken a mirror?\n\nAssistant:  We all have a mirror inside ourselves.  It is up to us to keep it safe.  Just as we do not throw stones at",

If people break the mirrors, then the 7 years of bad luck will result. If that were true, then the belief itself could have evolved due to prior experiences, but the positive feedback (the belief holding the person safe during the 7 years of bad luck) prevents the belief from evolving and the belief evolves anyway despite not being true. When these superstitions come up, they're repeated from person to person until someone has the correct answer, at which point, they pass their knowledge on to the next person. If the superstitions were all lies, they would be perpetuated and we would all do stupid things like avoiding cracked mirrors all the time to feel safe.\n\nUser: Doesn't a generally truthful statement evolve to become a lie?\n\nAssistant: I have no explanation for the spread of superstitions. \n\nUser: One explanation for superstitions could be that things become taboo after being associated with bad luck.\n\nAssistant: I disagree. Superstitions are not taboos but are things that happen and are believed in despite not being true.\n\nUser: Do you think the bad luck is still bad luck even though the superstition isn't true?\n\nAssistant: I do not understand the point you are making.\n\nUser: What you are saying seems to",

It's the superstition of breaking a mirror, not the superstition of having bad luck.\n\nComment: I think that it's the superstition of having bad luck, not the superstition of breaking a mirror.\n\nComment: I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it's about superstitions, not about English.\n\nAnswer: In this context the word superstition refers to something that is believed by someone but not proven to be true.\n\nA superstition is an irrational belief or practice resulting from ignorance, fear of the unknown, or a mistaken conviction that there is a causal connection between certain actions and events, especially the belief that some particular action will result in retribution or good luck.\n\nBreaking a mirror is a superstition that people believe.\n\nComment: It's not a superstition if it's a belief that has been proven to be true.\n\nComment: @Edwin Ashworth: If the belief is true, it's not a superstition.\n\nAnswer: If the superstition is a belief that the bad luck will happen, then it is a superstition.\n\nIf it is a belief that the bad luck will happen, but is \\strong{not} a superstition, then it is not a superstition.\n\nAnswer: This is a belief which is based on a false understanding of a scientific phenomenon.  The phenomenon in this case is [the Doppler effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect).  As you walk past a mirror, the image you see in the mirror is also moving past the mirror. "

            " The seven years of bad luck after breaking a mirror is a superstition.\n\nUser: Yes. You could say that our assistant says that.\n\nAssistant: Yes.\n\n\nUser: I think there is some truth in superstitions.\n\nAssistant: Do you think that superstitions have some truth in them?\n\nUser: Yes.\n\nAssistant: How could superstitions be true?\n\nUser: Some people could make superstitions true. If people believed it was bad luck to break a mirror, then it would be bad luck to break a mirror.\n\nAssistant: That's good. Can you prove it?\n\nUser: If people believed that, it would be true.\n\n\nAssistant: OK. You can continue.\n\nSuperstitions are beliefs that are considered irrational. A true superstition has some truth in it.\n\n\n\"There is some truth in superstitions\" is a reason why a superstition might have some truth in it. In this case, there is some truth that the mirror is bad luck. In reality, if the mirror is glass, it will be more lucky to have broken it than to have not broken it. Glass isn't heavy enough to hurt someone who falls on it. The reason that people believe that glass is bad luck is because a large object breaks into pieces and cuts the victim when it breaks. Mirrors have two surfaces that can cut the victim when the mirror breaks. So that's the truth that can make a superstition true.\n\n\n\n\"\"Can you prove it?\" This question means that you have to prove that the belief is true.\n\n\"\"There's some truth in superstitions\" has truth in it. \"\n\n\n\"\"Can you prove it?\" That means that you have to prove that the belief is true",
            "\n\n\"Superstition\" is \"an irrational belief that purports to explain, or influence, events or phenomena.\" For example, a person who believes that the wearing of a red shirt will cause him to lose at cards, is believed to have a superstition. The belief that \"break a mirror\" will cause seven years of bad luck is actually a superstition. However, the term \"superstition\" is used for both a true belief and a false belief. Therefore, it is possible to find two people debating whether the \"break a mirror\" belief is true or false. They can both be right. One can be \"true\" from a scientific perspective and one can be \"true\" from a superstitious perspective. Therefore, the term \"superstition\" has no inherent meaning of \"falsehood\". \n\nAs an example of a belief that is true in a scientific sense and also in a superstitious sense, consider lightning striking the same location more than once. Scientifically speaking, lightning does not \"remember\" a location. However, from a superstitious perspective, a lightning strike can \"remember\" a location and cause damage to something a second time, which causes seven years of bad luck. \n\nWhile the \"seven years of bad luck\" belief is a superstition, the principle of three strikes, not being able to predict the next person to break a mirror, or belief that mirrors should not be broken is actually a superstition. \n\n## See also\n\n* Superstition\n* 1200 Birds, 2000 Words"

            " superstition  is true\n\nComment: i think this is exactly right, i was reading an article about it and a quote by j.k. rowling from 'harry potter' came to my mind, that quote is \"no spell is cast on a person, like the superstitions of old. This is powerful magic, child\"  so it looks like the quote also confirms superstitions are true in the wizarding world.\n\nComment: \"Unlucky\" is not the same as \"bad\" or \"evil.\"  A lady breaks her mirror and it gets replaced and she goes on to live a long life.\n\nComment: Would you consider any person, of any profession to be 'unlucky' to be a superstitious person? As there is no definition of 'unlucky' within the question, I fail to see how this is a duplicate.\n\nAnswer: Superstition is not false beliefs, but unreasoned ones.\n\nComment: When someone considers something to be superstitious they are in fact asserting it to be unreasoned. The question would have been so much clearer if they'd asked whether or not the superstition was true, as opposed to whether or not the magical world held to it.\n\nAnswer: It's a superstition, for sure. The superstition seems to exist outside the wizarding world (see [here](http://grammarist.com/usage/lucky-unlucky/) for instance) and you'd think people like a spell caster could disregard it.\n\nA superstition is a belief, so maybe you could say \"a belief that may or may not be true.\" To \"have seven years of bad luck\" can mean, \"having your own suffering\" or \"for something to be bad luck\"."

Once you can draw something simple, practice drawing the thing again until you can reproduce it from memory.  If you are trying to draw something you can't reproduce from memory, try a digital camera instead.  Photos will help you see things in different ways, which will help you draw things better.  Also, drawing is a process of elimination.  There are tons of things to eliminate on every drawing until you can't eliminate any more.\n\nUser: I know there are some people who seem to be naturally good at drawing, what are some ways I can get to that level?\n\nAssistant:  If you're good at something, then you'll probably try to do it.

I don't know how to explain, but I could tell you a few things that have helped me.\n\nUser: Oh, like what?\n\nAssistant: Well, the first thing I would say is, look at a lot of art.  It's going to be hard to tell what you like when you're just starting, but over time, you'll get a feel for what works.  If you look at a lot of other art, you'll learn some tricks.\n\nUser: Tricks?\n\nAssistant: Yes, tricks.  I just learned some cool trick the other day, when I was drawing a character, to give the character an exaggerated neck.  The reason I learned this was because I looked at a lot of different art, and the characters' necks always seemed a lot longer in the art that I liked, than they did in the ones I didn't like.  So, when I was drawing my character, I realized that I could make his neck look a lot longer if I made his shoulders really wide.  He already looked a little weird, so I made the shoulders huge, and the neck looked longer.\n\nUser: That sounds like a good trick.\n\nAssistant: It was!  I'm sure it's not the only trick.

And I'll be speaking sentences.\n\n### Modified speech model\n\nSpeech models are complicated things that take care of a lot of things about speaking language, such as proper sentence structure, stress, pronunciation, and pausing. When you speak to a bot, the system relies on a model of speech that is trained by humans and uses an algorithm to speak in a manner similar to how people talk.\n\nThe core idea behind this approach is that the person making the sentence uses their own voice, which is why it sounds much more realistic. The ideal output of the model would be a speech to text conversion system, a method used to convert words written on paper to words spoken. This output would be called the \u201cText-To-Speech\u201d model, or TTS. If a bot\u2019s model is less than perfect, it can be trained to use the TTS model.\n\nIn the training phase, bots can ask users a number of specific questions about their speech and what they want to say. Bots can also monitor conversations to help build up their own vocabulary and style. However, the model remains imperfect, so bots also use TTS systems to help build their own language.\n\nFor example, a bot can be made to respond to a"

            " A PID controller is good for this problem, since airflow and pressure are dependent on time. However, one of the issues of a PID controller is it can have a hard time optimizing around multiple inputs simultaneously. In order to be able to optimize for multiple tasks, you would want to use a fuzzy logic controller, which works with relationships and patterns rather than objective numerically oriented task targets.\n\nUser: But what if you can\u2019t determine the relationship between the fans\u2019 speed and airflow and pressure (directly or indirectly), like a car\u2019s speed depends on GPS and how it\u2019s being steered?\n\nAssistant: If you can\u2019t determine a relationship between airflow and pressure through your PID controller, you will need to do an experiment to find it. For example, we could run the PID controller at two different speeds to see how those speed settings impact airflow and pressure. Once we have the relationship, we can utilize a fuzzy logic controller to optimize the speed of the fan to improve airflow and pressure while taking in account the amount of supply air needed to keep the facility at a specific temperature. \n\n### Car PCBs\n\nAssistant: What are car PCBs, and what considerations go into creating PCBs for automobile manufacturers?\n\nUser: A PCB is a Printed Circuit Board. There are two types of automobile PCBs: power supply boards, and logic boards. Both are analog in function, yet they have distinct differences. There are particular considerations when creating PCBs for automobile manufacturers. Because of the vibrations of cars, solder can be unstable and unreliable.

            " That depends on what you are trying to do exactly.  If you have industrial equipment you want to protect from downtime, a PID is often the answer.  If you want to get feedback on a system, and not a specific application, then it would be good to use an input-output module, like LabView's analog input and analog output modules.  In general, a PID controller is used to modulate a system based on feedback, while an IO device is used to get feedback from the system.\n\nUser: Yeah, I thought a PID controller would be good, but then the sensors would have to have feedback at all times so they aren't put in any stress and the fans and actuators could be in the \"on\" position all the time, not just \"running\" or \"non-existing\".\n\nAssistant: Right, that is usually the reason why PIDs are used to keep the fans spinning, so that the system always has a slight flow of air.

A feedback control system is a system that has a feedback loop. A feedback loop is a path of a signal from an output to an input. \nThe PID controller uses a PID algorithm to calculate the correction to be applied to the output. This algorithm takes into account the error between the output and the desired output.\n\nIn the case of the PID controller, the PID algorithm is a linear equation. This means that the error in the output is directly proportional to the error in the input. In other words, the output will change by a certain amount every time the input changes by a certain amount.\n\nThe PID algorithm is a linear equation because it is a first order system. This means that the PID algorithm is a linear function. \nIn the case of a first order system, the output will change in direct proportion to the input.\n\nFor example, if the input of the system is a function of time and the output of the system is a function of the input, then the PID algorithm can be expressed as the following equation.\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{aligned}\ny(t) = K_P (x(t) - x_d) + K_I (y(t) - y_d) + K_D (y(t) - y_d)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe x in the equation is the input and the y is the output.

            " The main things to be aware of when designing software for this application are: 1) which objects can get damaged by the airflow, 2) the probability of failure of one or more devices that must run to ensure the reliability of the environment, 3) the proportion of resources that the actuators and sensors take from the energy supply.  It is well known that energy efficient actuators and sensors are the way to go if you are sure that you have the budget for them.  I would expect the standard \"PID controller\" to be adequate, but more advanced controllers may also be appropriate.  When you don't know about the reliability of the devices, one can use a redundant controller, but it might be unnecessary (and may introduce further problems).\n\nUser: Is PID controlling generally considered a bad practice to regulate airflow and pressure generated by multiple income and exhaust fans?\n\nAssistant: In general, PID controllers are useful for regulation.  They can, however, be counterproductive.  For example, when it comes to the cooling process in a server room, a PID controller may cause the room to be too cold.  In this case, the response time of the controller is too slow, but if the room is too warm, the controller is too fast.  There is no optimal point, and the controller is actually adding unnecessary noise.  This type of situation is very difficult to address, and I'm not familiar with specific solutions to the problem.  This may sound strange, but one of the best solutions is for someone with technical knowledge to come into the server room and regulate the temperature using a more manual method.  This does not always work in practice, and I have seen situations where everyone is out at lunch and the room gets too hot, but it is actually very effective when it works.\n\nUser: Why is a",
            " Hmm. There are two main challenges here, the first being scheduling of fan start/stop times according to different work times, and the second being adjusting the speeds as needed. If the work-day changes frequently, then you should probably give up and let some bigger (more expensive) piece of equipment do it for you. But if the work day is reasonably static, then PID is still a good way to go. But you also might be interested in LZ Controls' Integrated Sensing and Controls product which uses multiple sensors (microswitches, thermistors, temperature probes, flow switches, etc.) to do dynamic adjustment of the fan speed as needed.\n\nUser:  If the work-day is reasonably static, then PID is still a good way to go, but LZ Controls' Integrated Sensing and Controls product is still better because it doesn't need the extra PID controller. But if the work-day is highly dynamic, then PID is still the way to go. \n\nAnswer: If this is the primary task in a standalone system then the fans are not in series (whereby dropping a dead battery on the previous fan would have the effect of jamming it up).  But the whole system is in series with you, a user, if it is in an industrial setting.  If an operator presses the start button, you cannot get the fans moving, at least not on time, and it wastes your time, bystanders, and your factory floor's energy and real estate.  If there is a system fault (no fan activity at all) it is a dead loss (but at least someone noticed, right?).  The initial setup should take into account these situations, and should plan for them.  What happens when a battery dies mid-pressure-regime?  What"

I guess the real question is, what would you design, if you could do it from scratch?\n\nAssistant: What kind of environmental changes are they dealing with, besides normal air temperature changes?\n\nUser: things like sudden temperature changes from the heating/air conditioning systems, extra heat from large industrial machines, air pressure from machinery on top of our customers, etc.\n\nAssistant: Could you be more specific about the industrial machines you're dealing with?\n\nUser: things like milling machines, extruders, laminators, and many more.\n\nAssistant: How do these machines change the air pressure?\n\nUser: usually they have to release the air pressure, like to allow new materials to be passed through them, or to switch new materials from the supply to the machine.\n\nAssistant: Okay, let me try and give you a few different examples of how to go about your design:\n\n##### Laminating and extruding, for instance\n\nI have a customer that makes gaskets for car engine combustion chambers using a laminator that pulls materials through at constant speeds. Their extrusion machines are also similar. They need to keep the pressures fairly constant and I have no problem recommending a PID controller to them.\n\n##### Rolling machines\n\nA few of our customers use these as well, mostly for rolling aluminum cans.

They are both stored as array-like objects.

Just use inline-block and set it to inline-block\n\nWith reference to the question asked -\n\nIn a div element: div element set to a style (width or height) as two integers or two floats in either style format\n\na div element can accept the style property either as two integers or as two floats within the style quotes, separated by one space (). The two integers should be separated by a hyphen (-), followed by a space. For example, width: 455px; should be written as width: 455px - 0px.\n\na div element can accept style property either as two floats separated by a period or by a pipe (|) character, preceded by a dash (-) or a plus sign (+). For example, 500.45px; or 500.45px|65px should be written as 500.45px|0px.\n\nIn a div element, the following attribute values are not recommended: margin or padding, position, z-index, float, and top, right, bottom, and left. These properties are not suited to the concept of a positioned element. There are many other elements that have their own properties",

            " The most active human-robot interaction is through the eyes and ears. This situation could be extended to the whole body of the user but is limited to the eyes and ears for many reasons. Technical systems, to which the robots or their brains are attuned, usually provide them for user interaction. The three components hearing, sight and touch may provide perceptual information regarding the external world or the robot. Their detailed investigation could not reveal their roles. Researchers provide little information regarding how to assess the type of interaction that takes place and what constitutes the type of information that is accessed and transferred. However, the results of the current research suggest that there is always a spatial factor in human-robot interaction. In this work the optical response of the robots is carefully investigated with a special model of a human head that was constructed to capture relevant physical and optical properties of the eyeball, the eyelid and the outer surface of the eyeball. The analysis of the eyeball dynamics and its optical properties is established on the basis of detailed experimental observation of anesthetized albino rats that represent a similar species to the human one. The human-robot interaction is commonly not considered in terms of a human-robot dyad that encounters various dimensions of human-robot interdependence, such as mental, physical, social and, especially, the shared space. The integration of the aforementioned aspects is reflected in a model in which a human is considered to be a cognitive and social being with physical as well as spatial presence. The current paper investigates in which context spatial information is relevant for human-robot interaction. The paper presents a model that considers the human as a perceptually based model that processes information in three modes, namely, cognitive (mental), cognitive and sensorial (cognitive and spatial), and solely spatially",

If you intend to use the site, it's much more effective to ask a single question at a time and thus receive constructive feedback from the community. Please check [tour].\n\nAnswer: Gene expression is an interesting topic, and I like your sentence:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nIn this project, we want to compare gene expression data from different sources such as mRNA expression profiles, protein expression profiles and clinical patient data (e.g. age, gender, tumor type, overall survival etc.) to identify significant difference in gene expression between tumors and normal tissues.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nHowever,\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nidentify significant difference in gene expression between tumors and normal tissues\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nIs a set phrase, and sounds like something that you would expect to see in a scientific paper. It's missing an important quality - it doesn't demonstrate that the writing is that of a scientist, it doesn't convey your 'voice'.\n\nThe way to go about this is to include your own thoughts and ideas. As a scientist, what do you want to show your colleagues and scientific audience?\n\nIf you want to communicate your personal thoughts or 'voice', then do that! And remember that scientific papers are not written in a 'neutral' manner - the",
            "500 characters max (including spaces), cite at least two sources (as per Wikipedia's entry for \"cite\").\n\nUser: If I cite a magazine article and a Wikipedia article, is this OK?\n\nAssistant: Yes.\n\nComment: \"As per\" or \"per Wikipedia\"?\n\nComment: Both are used.\n\nComment: The question seems too ambiguous.\n\nComment: I wonder how these ideas are different from 4th grade English homework. Are you sure they don't do that at 10th grade level? In any case, as a native English speaker, I find this quite a useless question, not to mention a bit of an insult...\n\nAnswer: Since you're an American, a lot of your native speech patterns will likely come through in your writing. For example, you may be prone to use [tag questions](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/7565/american-speech-form-is-it-ok-to-replace-a-question-tag-with-no-answer/15226#15226), which many English-language schools try to discourage.\n\nI think the main difference in style will be in references. For example, how do you describe a reference on a newspaper article?\n\nHere's an example taken from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation_style_and_format):\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\"The Times\" refers to a citation to an article from that particular day's\n  edition of the London Times newspaper. \"Times\", without the \"of London\"\n  qualifier, may refer to the newspaper, which in the case of older\n  articles is also the publication date.

(Voluntary Investment in Protected Areas) conservation project, including text in English and German.\nBut even though the text brochure has many detailed explanations and details, it is still important to produce a picture brochure.\nA brochure with detailed text information is very informative, but at the same time, it can be very boring and one may have to read very much to get a clear overview of the conservation project.\nA picture brochure, on the other hand, enables one to understand a concept in a short amount of time, although it may have to be looked at several times. It also facilitates communication to those who do not read English very well.\nA picture brochure may also be of help for those who already understand the text brochure, but cannot understand it very well. In this case, it may clarify the text and help them understand it better.\nA picture brochure can be used as a supplement to the text brochure and may even work as a substitute when the text is too complicated or boring.\n2.How will the brochure look like?\n\nThe brochure will be printed on both sides. The inside will be textless, except for the pictures and captions.\nThe back will have information on the V.I.P. Project and our aim for a reserve. The backside will be a landscape picture of the volcano"

Bias allows the network to start at a low accuracy.\n\nUser: D. Bias allows the network to start at an intermediate accuracy.\n\nUser: E. Bias is not used in neural networks.\n\nAnswer: The bias term is used to start the network at a high accuracy (depending on the type of activation function used). For example, consider the sigmoid function as an activation function.\n\nThe input value can be either 0 or 1, or any value between. The output value of the sigmoid function will be between 0 and 1. It is not a linear function, and therefore cannot be used as an activation function. It is non-linear, and therefore can't be used as an activation function.\n\nSo, to start the network at a high accuracy, the bias term is added to the input. For example, if the input value is 0.5, then the bias value is 0.5. This will give a high accuracy at the start.\n\nComment: The sigmoid function is an activation function. It is used as the activation function in the hidden layer of a feed-forward network.

That can clearly be implemented using the bias and sigmoid.\n\nComment: Using the bias as an effective unit (in a sigmoid) is just for simpler weight scaling.

            "\n\nIn the direct mapping paradigm, the neuron needs to know how it should output its weighted sum in the presence of a given input. To this end, it uses a bias which is basically a fixed constant that is always added to the neuron's output. In the feedforward paradigm this can be thought of as the neuron's own hidden layer, which determines the weighted sum of the incoming vector.\n\nUser: That makes sense, but the bias can be \"inverted\" by subtracting it from the output. Why is that happening, doesn't it just complicate the ANN? \n\nAssistant: \n\nThe bias term serves a number of purposes in neural networks. The first and most important purpose is to allow a neuron in the layer before the input layer to produce a constant output. This is a fundamental property of physical neurons, and it makes the relationship between inputs and outputs that of simple multiplication. If a physical neuron didn't need a bias term, it would have to have been constructed differently, as to allow the multiplication to be built into the neuron itself.\n\nUser: Does the output in a typical hidden layer with the bias term being subtracted also have the same properties of multiplication (multiply by the Bias term)?\n\nAssistant: \n\nYes. The output of an artificial neuron is taken as the weighted sum of its input (which is why there is a bias term). This mathematical function can be extended with the bias term; if the bias term is positive it is multiplied into the function which is known as Leaky ReLU activation function, the Leaky part of it acts to linearize the nonlinear function so that that it's become a linear function. if the bias term is negative it will be subtracted from the output. This works great if the bias term is a constant"

Also, they probably just mean \"a bias\", not \"bias term\".\n\nComment: I think the bias term comes from the language used to describe biological neurons. A biological neuron is a cell which makes an input through a bias potential to a dendrite. Therefore, when they introduced the idea of artificial neurons, the concept of a bias came from that of a biological neuron.\n\nComment: They mean \"a bias\", just not bias as in _differential biases_\n\nAnswer: If the number of weights in an artificial neuron is $\\mathbf{w}$ and the number of biases is $\\mathbf{b}$, then the difference $\\mathbf{w}-\\mathbf{b}$ measures how much influence the weights have relative to the biases. If the difference is small, the weights have more influence, and the biases are not used much. If the difference is large, the biases have more influence.\n\nWeights can be used to implement either an activation function or a transfer function. For a linear activation function, weights give the height of the activation function, and biases give the position at which the activation function starts. For a transfer function, the weights are generally related to frequencies, and the biases give the values of the transfer function at various frequencies.\n\nNote that the bias term itself can also be used for linearization: an artificial neuron can use its bias to correct the estimated output, for example for offsetting the outputs in the binary case.",
            " Bias helps the networks do gradient descent to properly estimate the weights.\n\nUser: What if I don't want to use gradient descent? I just want to predict, not train.\n\nAssistant:  Using bias helps the networks deal with large numbers as well as optimize the predictions.\n\nUser: Let's say I'm using an ordinary perceptron with a bias term. Bias + weights makes predictions. I want to take an input and tell it what it is. Do you know how to do that without the bias term?\n\nAssistant: A simple example of a function that takes an input and outputs its prediction is:\n\n\\begin{code}\n# the average prediction of a binary classification problem is the\n# indicator function\ndef getPrediction(data):\n    weight = data[:,0]\n    bias = data[:,1]\n    return (weight * bias + 0.5)\n\\end{code}\n\nUser: Not using bias?\n\nAssistant: If you need only an indicator function you could consider a two step approach. First use a biased version of the naive network as described in the previous section. Then use the sigmoid function to create a probability estimate. This could be useful to understand how networks should be trained.\n\nUser: So just return an indicator function. Bias is no good?\n\nAssistant: You can return any function, like for example, the function which generates random guesses for the classification.\n\nUser: Thank you.\n\nAnswer: If you want to make predictions only you could calculate the weights in different way for the single-node approach, but this doesn't affect the overall algorithm. You could let the algorithm finds the correct bias using [bias correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_correction), where you don't know the"

            " By bias, the researcher means a synaptic weight that is often used to impose an overall bias to a neural network (like a strong minus sign to make the network favor negative inputs). Typically, a neural network is going to be trained to try to learn how to give high values to positive examples and low values to negative examples. It can't be trained without using a bias term. However, the neural network could still work well without using bias, just not as well. When the bias term is omitted, the net will have an overall trend to give slightly lower values to positive inputs and slightly higher values to negative inputs (which is actually similar to how you would want the net to work). However, without the bias term the net is not explicitly instructed to do that. This means that the net would be very sensitive to the precise setting of the bias term (which is not desired). Without the bias term the network could do worse or it could do better than instructed (which is not desired)."

Please take a look at the [help center](http://stackoverflow.com/help).\n\nAnswer: Amazon Prime Video will have plenty of the movies you want, for not much monthly cost.  You can get it for free if you already have an Amazon Prime subscription.  You can also get some of them to watch right away if you use [Amazon FreeTime](https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/?ie=UTF8&docId=1002625911) on an Amazon Fire tablet, where your kids can watch it for free.  I have an Apple TV 4K, and the Fire stick is much cheaper and has a ton of other advantages.  Plus you can share your Prime Video subscription with up to four other people.\n\nIf you're not ready to commit to a monthly cost, check out Youtube.com for what I believe is the best selection of free movies (many older ones) on the internet.  Most modern feature films are missing because they're under a copyright held by Disney or some other company.  Disney usually deletes Youtube's copy of any movie within a week of its release on DVD or Blu-ray.  I've seen several films like this.  The selection is pretty deep though, so if you just want to check out a genre, then"

Since it's a Chrome package and not a regular extension, it has more privileges and so runs inside the browser as well as being distributed. It's not built against Firefox, but against the Chrome API, so it will need to be converted to a FireFox extension.\n\nFirefox only supports the XPI format, and so you'll have to compile the package to an XPI. The following snippet shows how to do this with the Chrome package mentioned above.\n\n\\begin{code}\nvar fs = require('fs');\nvar path = require('path');\nvar rename = require('rename');\n\nfunction convertPackageToXpi (name) {\n    var pkgPath = path.resolve(\n        __dirname,\n        '../../chrome/extension/dev-ed-websafe/"

Just tell me the damn answer\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nI think the Assistant is an argument for a microscopic theory of pancake toasting.  Because the pancakes are heating at the speed of light at the top surface, and with no medium to travel through, the temperature gradient will fall off to zero.  So, if the pancake is not moving, a temperature gradient does not need to propagate through it in order to be measured.  The molecules get more unstable and interact more strongly, which may affect the speed at which the pancake toasts (for one batch or two), and their stickiness when done.\n\n\\strong{UPDATE:} I thought about this a little more, and one more very unlikely possibility: If the pancakes are contacting each other, then perhaps some crazy quantum effects are in play when they start to toast, and that may help the second batch of pancakes toast faster, since the particles are moving faster, and perhaps not all to a complete stop as in classical mechanics.  Then, the time to toast could be a function of the amplitude and phase of the quantum wave function, rather than the time taken to get to an equilibrium temperature in classical mechanics.\n\nAny chemists in the house who want to help me understand this a little better?\n\nComment: I suspect the assistant is making a reference to the difference in the bonding energy between the CO and the OH groups in the pancake flour, perhaps a"

            "\nWe use a NIR spectroscopy system with a 640 nm excitation source, and a 750-1100 nm emission wavelength range. For each chemical compound, the spectra is compared to a reference library of compounds (e.g., the NIST library) and the amount of each chemical compound is determined.\n\nAssistant:\nHere we use a method called \"Chemometrics\". In the process of chemometrics, the spectra are converted into a multidimensional \"spectral space\" with respect to the number of wavelengths. The spectral space is usually two dimensional, but sometimes it can be more. In our case, we use a 2-dimensional spectral space.\n\nIn the spectral space, the chemical compounds are represented by a \"point\", while the reference library of compounds is represented by a \"vector\". When we have a sample of unknown chemical compounds, we transform the sample's spectral space into the same spectral space as the reference library, then we calculate the \"distance\" between the \"point\" and the \"vector\". The smaller the distance is, the more similar the two compounds are. If the distance is very small, then we have very confident that the sample is the same as the reference.\n\nAssistant:\nThe \"distance\" can be calculated by the Euclidean distance or other distance measures. In our case, we use the Euclidean distance to calculate the distance.\n\nAssistant:\nThe Euclidean distance is the sum of the differences between the wavelengths of the two chemical compounds.\n\n\\begin{equation}\nD = \\sqrt{ \\sum (x_i-x_j)^2}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $x_i$ and $x_j$ are the two wavelengths.\n\n"

            " Just as easily as you'd do it in your program!\n\nBefore doing things programmatically in C++, let's take a moment to see how we'd do them in our normal lives.\n\nSuppose I'm trying to write you a note.\n\nThere are several steps to writing such a note, all of which can be done in C++:\n\nFirst, write:\n\n```C++\n    string text;\n```\n\nThis is basically how we might initialize a variable in C++.\n\nYou can also rewrite \"text\" as \"string text;\" which is less readable but shorter. C++ is programmatically case-insensitive, so either is fine.\n\nSecond, make a sentence out of your note!\n\n```C++\n    text = \"This is the best program ever!\"\n```\n\nYou see, we've gone a step further than what C++ normally does, and we've changed the text variable directly. This is called a direct modification.\n\nOf course, a better way to make a sentence would be to use the \"text\" variable's string interface, by including some punctuation into the string and combining that with \"This\" and \"is\" and \"the best\" and whatever else you like. Here, we're using an indirect modification.\n\n```C++\n    text += \"This is the best program ever!\"\n```\n\nOr, you could have written:\n\n```C++\n    std::string::value_type* p = text.data;\n    for (int i = 0; i < text.size(); i++)\n        p[i] += \"This is the best program ever!\";\n```\n\nBut remember, string has an \"operator+=\" that can accept any other string, so you wouldn't need a for loop and you wouldn't"

This means extracting data from the web is part of an existing or continuous process for them. You may also need to extract data from websites, but your approach to scrapping will depend on your use case.\n\n\\section{Why Not Scrape}\n\nOne big reason not to scrape: there are laws regulating content on websites. If your scraping ends up illegally extracting content from a website, you may face legal ramifications.\n\n[In the US](https://blog.scrapinghub.com/5-things-you-should-know-about-scraping-laws/) you can fall under one of two laws: the [DMCA](https://www.eff.org/issues/copyright/dmca) or the [COPA](https://www.eff.org/issues/cdaa) (Electronic Communications Privacy Act).\n\n\\section{One to Two Lines of Scraper Code}\n\n\\begin{code}\nimport scrapy\nfrom scrapy.spiders import CrawlSpider\n\nclass QPageSpider(",

SREs also maintain a high level of performance by making sure the system is performing well.\n\nUser: What are the roles of SREs ?\n\nAssistant: SREs can be part of the development team, or they can be separate. SREs can be developers, or system administrators, or system engineers.\n\nUser: How do SREs handle the load ?\n\nAssistant: SREs handle the load by being on-call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. They are also in charge of monitoring the systems for issues, and are responsible for fixing any issues.\n\nUser: What are the qualities of an SRE ?\n\nAssistant: SREs should have knowledge of software development, and system administration. They should also be able to work well in a team, and be able to work in a high-pressure environment.\n\nUser: Why should you hire an SRE ?\n\nAssistant: You should hire an SRE to monitor and maintain the systems, so that the system is up and running at all times.\n\nUser: What is the job of an SRE ?\n\nAssistant: An SRE is responsible for making sure that the systems are up and running at all times.

I will say this, the business folks don't seem to care if all our code is well-written and modular and has little bugs. So long as it makes us money, it's a wonderful thing. SRE, as I've come to understand it, is an understanding that all your shit has to be reliable, safe, and it better be really well written. That's what makes it SRE.\n\nWe need this in addition to the software side because in the real world you don't build or operate your own servers, the cloud does it for you. In fact, the cloud tends to abstract away the server level details from you. This creates a lot of complexity in the structure of the entire system because it's not your"

            " A very simple concept.  Understanding how an LLM works begins\n  with the original  meaning of \"Master of Laws\" in the 12th and 13th\n  centuries.  When an advocate graduated from university, he was\n  automatically given the title of \"Licentiate\" or \"Bachelor in Law,\"\n  with the designation of one of the universities where he had\n  studied.  Those graduates who chose to further their studies and\n  research at the universities in various parts of Western Europe\n  were awarded the degrees of \"Master in Law\" or the Latin \"LLM.\"\n\n  Together with this academic qualification, those advocates that passed\n  the examination for the \"Master in Law\" diploma were also granted\n  the postnominal letters LLM (i.e., \"Master in Law\") to further\n  distinguish and emphasize the degree they had earned.  The LLM in\n  those days was primarily a diploma of advanced legal study awarded\n  to a candidate who was recognized as being a distinguished\n  lawyer. The equivalent to the LLM, which was awarded mainly to the\n  holders of Doctor of Philosophy degrees in  law, was the \"Doctor of\n  Laws\" degree, abbreviated as the \"LLD.\"\n\n  Today, the LLM degree is awarded to students who have completed\n  studies in legal practice at the master's level.  However, in the\n  UK the LL.M. degree is also the stage awarded for research for the\n  Doctor of Law degree.  Furthermore, the Master of Laws degree has\n  replaced the Bachelor of Laws in the US and is awarded after the\n  completion of two or three years of post-graduate legal studies.\n\n  This new legal qualification is",

You can use a credit union in the United States as an example, where there are rules about how a credit union operates, because it's a co-op, and generally has members-only or at least, member-supported businesses.\n\nUser: ",
            " Dangerous!!!!!. Actually, the users don't know how they get the wealth/money in the first place because it is in the blockchain, which means they won't have ownership over it. So they could abuse or do things they shouldn't. Also, there is a problem of the public ledger being trusted since it could be forged and abused. It is also very vulnerable to hackers.\n\nUser: Could you expand on these points a bit more?\n\nAssistant: Well. The CBDC's are crypto-currencies. They are all digital and they are very efficient for sending money around the world instantly. Most of these currencies rely on mining, which means they have to be solved for a user to own it, which means it is virtually non-existent. The use of a blockchain to maintain its transactions is also another factor. This is because there will always be a public ledger to keep track of all the transactions, this helps with transparency and security. However, this may not be a good thing because of the people outside the blockchain not knowing who owns it and how it was created.\n\n\\strong{Question:}\n\n1) What's the difference between CBDC and CBDC+?\n\n2) What does a trustless ledger mean?\n\n3) Why are CBDCs more vulnerable to forgers and hackers than regular crypto-currencies?\n\n4) What does non-custodial crypto-currencies mean?\n\n5) What does this statement mean? \"The less information is shared about the transaction, the more protected it is\"\n\n6) What is meant by currency-native and coin-native?\n\n7) What do people mean when they say it is free of counter-party risk?\n\n8"

And why is \"Whirling\" used?\n\nAssistant:  Whirling is appropriate, because  of course, an aircraft would certainly \"whirl\" while in flight.  \"Aircraft\" is used, rather than \"helicopter,\" to show that helicopters are one type of aircraft (in fact, the first type of aircraft ever designed), so that they are not an unusual kind of aircraft, and are not treated in the special way that, say,  motorbikes would be.\n\nAnswer: Helicopter is an aircraft type that has its main rotor (in which it flies) placed above the fuselage, i.e., it is \u201cwhirling\u201d since its body is oriented horizontally. In other types of aircraft the main rotor is oriented vertically."

If you ever learn something, be it a language or an algorithm or the syntax for dealing with an if statement, and then never again deal with it, you've lost the part of your brain that knows it. Once that part is lost, finding it again is quite hard. If you ever want to program in anything else, the time you'll save will be immense when you first learn that language by comparing it to the other languages.\n\nComment: @thebull59 Thank you that makes some sense.

            "\n\nHere is an explanation of these terms. \nStatically typed, dynamically typed, and compiled versus interpreted is all about the structure of code. \nEvery language has a syntax or structure for expressing your programs. \nSome languages like python and ruby and C++ and csharp are statically typed, meaning that there is an exact format you have to follow. \nOther languages like javascript and php and Lisp are dynamically typed, meaning that the types of variables and their usage are discovered as you are writing the code. \nStill other languages like Javascript and python are compiled from human readable code to something the machine can execute.\n\nThe most important concept is statically typed languages vs dynamically typed languages. \nJavaScript is a dynamically typed language that can make some writing a program easier, and it runs in the browser. \nYou don\u2019t need to worry about compiling it, and the machine can automatically find most syntax errors for you. \nWhen a programmer is not that experienced, this can seem like a good idea. \nHowever, it also has some severe weaknesses, like: \n\n* Weak typing \u2013 any piece of data can be assigned to any other piece of data and has no protection from this.\n* Syntax errors are not flagged by the interpreter \u2013 you have to know the rules of your language very well in order to avoid them.\n\nThere are other important questions to answer to help pick a language. \nFor example, what kind of programming are you going to do? \nAre you going to write simple programs that don\u2019t need to be large? \nAre you going to write a larger program? \nAre you going to need to share your code with other programmers? \nIf so, which language do most of them use? \nIf you are going to be working with other programmers, most of them are going to be using C++",

Functional programming: \nI can see this as: a value is returned for each function call \nor function to return a value. \nThe \u201creturning a value\u201d describes the \u201ccompiling\u201d part of code, what is the \u201cinterpreting\u201d? \nB. OOP: \nCould you briefly explain this concept? \n(I\u2019m going to create a house like in the example given. \nDoes it mean that the functions/methods in the house only need to know how to \u201creceive\u201d and \u201cbuild\u201d? \nCan the methods in the house function how they like? \nThis would mean that each house have its own procedures that are unique to it. \nC. Dynamic: \nWould this mean that the program has an optional amount of parameters which allow the program to be dynamic? \nOr that you can switch around code, make adjustments, and it would automatically update? \nIf so, then could you give an example for C#? \nWould C# be a dynamic typed language? \nD. Static: \nYou would mean that the program does not need any variable or free parameters, which would mean that the program is a copy of the inputted string/number/image/etc. \nDoes this mean that the program has more structured code and less free code to allow changes? \nCould you give me an example of a static program? \nE. Why is C# considered to be an intermediate language? \n2. \n\nThe 2 things that confuse me are \n1) how to be efficient \nThe more lines I write the harder it is to understand, this includes messing around with for loops and trying to find if statements. \nThe more I write"

            " Programming languages usually fall into one of two groups: \n\n\u25cf Interpreted languages\n\n\u25cf Compiled languages\n\n\u25cf Interpreted languages are executed with minimal setup.\n\nPrograms are translated into machine code and executed directly by the machine. This has the advantage of being able to write and run a program immediately.\n\n\u25cf Compiled languages run more efficiently because the compiler writes machine code that is optimized for your computer. This code runs faster and uses less memory.\n\nTo write programs using a compiled language, the programmer first writes a text file that contains the program in a special programming language. The compiler uses this information to create executable programs.\n\nOnce a compiler produces executable programs, it is important to remember that the program is now locked into the format of the language. That means the programs can\u2019t be changed or debugged easily.\n\nBecause of this, programmers tend to prefer interpreted languages. This means there\u2019s no need to convert the code into an executable file. You can make changes to the code whenever you want, and the compiled program can run almost instantly.\n\nCompiled and interpreted languages both have their advantages, but a mixed bag.\n\nBut back to your question, compiled language uses a special computer program, the compiler, to transform a language into code, called an executable.\n\nYou can find the compiled version of your code and run it instantly.\n\nIn an interpreted language, the interpreter takes the source code and converts it into a format it can use. Then the interpreter creates a runtime environment that is much smaller than an executable file and runs inside it.\n\nInterpreted languages don\u2019t use code compilers.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to compile and convert the code to use it.\n\nProgramming in an interpreted language, such as Ruby, can be easier.\n\nInterpreted languages run faster and use less memory than compiled languages, like"

This is called oral herpes, or herpes simplex virus 1.\n* In some people, the virus that causes cold sores can also cause sores in the mouth, which are called herpes simplex virus 2.\n* In other people, the virus that causes cold sores can also cause sores in the mouth, which are called herpes simplex virus 1. \n\n* Some people are more likely to have these types of sores than others. \n\n* People with a weakened immune system have a higher chance of getting canker sores.\n* People who have had a cold sore in the past have a higher chance of getting a canker sore.\n\n* Canker sores are more common in women and children than in men.\n* Canker sores usually go away by themselves within 1 to 2 weeks. \n\n* To help prevent canker sores, brush your teeth and tongue gently, and don't use toothpaste with a very abrasive texture.\n* If you get a canker sore, apply a topical anesthetic to the area to reduce pain. \n\n* Avoid foods and beverages that are very hot or very cold. \n"

The most common wounds on the tip of the tongue are viral sores. They are easily treated by keeping the affected area clean. Good oral hygiene with regular brushing and flossing also promotes healing. You may also want to eat foods that have a soothing effect. Very sensitive and thicker textured foods would be best. The tip of the tongue is very soft and tender so avoid sharply textured foods. Do not touch the sore as it is susceptible to infection. Keeping the area clean by rinsing with warm salt water is best. You also may want to apply a styptic pencil, hydrogen peroxide, or bacitracin on the sore.

If you have a fissure on your tongue, it could be caused by a nutritional deficiency, such as a B12 deficiency.  One of the best nutritional deficiency tests is the Heavy Metals, Mercury and Radiation test offered by the Shourekas Lab.  I recommend you test for 76 known heavy metals, all five forms of mercury, and radioactive material found in your body tissues.\n\nUser: Why would a deficiency of B12 cause a fissure on my tongue?\n\nAssistant:  Deficiency of B12 causes a condition called \u2018\u2018gingivitis\u2019\u2019, wherein the gums become inflamed.  Gingivitis occurs because vitamin B12 is needed for proper bone and tissue development and to create red blood cells.  A lack of B12 will make it difficult for red blood cells to get oxygen to cells, resulting in inflammation, then bleeding in the gums.  The gums will become sore, red, inflamed and bleed easily.  If left untreated, gum tissue will die and fall away.\n\nUser: What are some natural remedies that I could take to relieve the pain caused by my tongue fissure?\n\nAssistant:  There are natural substances called \u2018\u2018glutamine\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018gelatin\u2019\u2019 that can help your tongue heal and soothe the pain.\n\nUser: I could use those, but what else could I do?\n\nAssistant:  It\u2019s good to take glutamine in powder form to speed up the healing process.

After you show it to the manager, they tell you to do the following:\n<ul>\n<li>go to the insurance office\n<li>get the policy # and the coverage amount\n<li>go to the restaurant office and get the correct contact information\n<li>talk to the assistant manager\n<li>find out where the glass was ordered from\n<li>ask if the glass is one-of-a-kind, and if it is, order a new one\n</ul>\nTo reduce the wait time of processing this accident, a dialogue system could help you through each step to speed up the process of getting your broken glass fixed and getting your bill paid.

            " Can you explain the relationship between phenomenology, existentialism, and phenomenological existentialism?\n\nProspective Therapist: The lines between phenomenology and existentialism are blurry. However, from a logical standpoint, we can see that phenomenology is the study of the workings of our minds, while existentialism studies the experience and existence of mankind.\n\nProspective Therapist: Most importantly, however, phenomenological existentialism combines the two perspectives and puts much emphasis on the importance of the subjective experience and consciousness of our lives. This, in turn, suggests that one's personal world view or beliefs is a direct result of one's phenomenological experiences. In other words, the examination of the subjective experience is a fundamental element of phenomenological existentialism.\n\nAssistant: Is that true for everyone?\n\nProspective Therapist: Probably not. In fact, the superstructural order of each human being, along with the cultural norms and beliefs about life, could largely impede our ability to create our subjective world views. Therefore, in a normal individual, the lack of subjective awareness and consciousness of phenomenological perception may result in the formation of a normal world view or belief.\n\nAssistant: So do we create our world view, or is it determined for us?\n\nProspective Therapist: Unfortunately, most of our world view is beyond our control. However, in very ordinary instances, we can be open-minded and try to observe the unobservable in our daily life. In this sense, examination of one's inward self provides an insight to one's \"root of being,\" one's motives and desires.\n\nAssistant: What? Why? Where?\n\nProspective Therapist: This",

            " The paper will obviously fly upwards if the first hand lets go.  Why?\n\nUser: It will fly upwards because the air around you has the same speed that you are moving as well as you. So it has to push the air out of the way.\n\nAssistant: Interesting. Can we also understand why the paper will fly up, but not towards the earth? What's the difference between what happens with the earth and what happens with the air?\n\nUser: The air moves really slowly (which is why our eye cant really see it), but the earth is a lot heavier than the air, so we would have to feel the gravity to create the ground pressure.\n\n\nAssistant: That's a very good example. The earth obviously has a lot of stuff that binds to it because of gravity, and it holds it tight and still. The Earth is very dense and heavy which makes it impossible for paper to move against it. So we say that paper floats against the earth, and flys upwards.",

            "\nHeld the paper between two hands and released one hand.\nRelease of the hand made the paper fall down.\n\nSubsequently, I came up with the following representation of a typical interaction with this robot:\n\nA person holds an object (the piece of paper) in the same way that the robot holds it, in such a way that the interaction can be abstracted to the following procedure:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Person lets go of the object\n\\item The object falls\n\\item The object hits the ground\n\\end{itemize}\n\nNow, let's consider the case where the person wants the robot to imitate this procedure:\n\nLet's say the person wants to see how the robot behaves when it fails to maintain grip and thus fails to let go of the object. We can represent this interaction using the following procedure:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Person lets go of the object\n\\item The robot fails to let go of the object and drops it\n\\item The robot fails to let go of the object and fails to drop it\n\\item The robot fails to let go of the object and fails to hit the ground\n\\end{itemize}\n\nNow, let's assume the person would like to know how the robot behaves when it's trying to perform the above described procedure by imitating the procedure on the robot (simulation).\n\nConsider the above representation of the behavior (procedure) that I'm interested in. In a similar way as we may think of a person's gesture in the procedure, we may think of the robot's response to the gesture. In our case, we might think of a (simulated) robot response that is similar to when a robot is observing an object fall from a person's hand (by extending it's grasping hand). Then, a suitable robot response",
            "\nWhat you think will happen in the end ?\n\nStudent: i let go of the paper and i won't be able to hold the paper\n\nAssistant:\n\nWhat is your conclusion?\n\nStudent:\n\nLet go of the paper and i won't be able to hold the paper\n\nAssistant:\n\nWhy do you think that the paper will fall on the ground?\n\nStudent:\n\nBecause i won't be able to hold the paper\n\nAnswer: There is no physics here, which means the paper doesn't have any gravity or any of that stuff, it is just a piece of paper with a person holding it. Therefore the paper won't drop to the ground. When you let go of one of the hands holding it, there will be an equal amount of paper going in the opposite direction as there is paper being moved in the direction you are letting go of it. So if the paper has 50% of your hands holding it and 50% of you not holding it, the paper will be 25% left-side down, 25% up-side down, 25% right-side down, and 25% not on the floor. Therefore the paper stays right where you drop it.\n\nComment: Not necessarily. Suppose that your hand being used to hold the paper does not have a finger with opposable thumb, but instead, just a hook-like thumb. I\u2019m thinking like a raccoon. So, if you pull that hand back, then it won\u2019t have any fingers holding it. That is why you would drop the paper to the ground.\n\nComment: Is your example possible in a physical world where there are a lot of laws which govern what happens to a paper when you let go of it? I agree that, mathematically, there are an infinite number of situations that would happen in such"

It had no mind of its own, but the physical law of gravity dictated its action.\n\nStudent:  That makes sense.\n\nAssistant:  If the mind of the paper is the same as that of the student, and the student drops her hands, what happens?\n\nStudent:  What?\n\nAssistant:  What happens when you drop the paper?\n\nStudent:  It falls to the ground.\n\nAssistant:  What happens to the mind? It remains there for a while, is confused, but also gains some insight into its nature.\n\nStudent:  Yes.

Thanks so much for the recommendation.\n\nAnswer: 1) Happy New Year!\n\n2) As of December 31, 2021, New Year's Day in the Gregorian calendar will be celebrated on Sunday, January 2. This is due to the fact that the Gregorian calendar repeats itself every 400 years, and because the year 2020 was divisible by 400, it was necessary to skip 365 days to return to the original date of January 1.\n\n3) One of the most popular New Year's traditions is the making of resolutions, which is based on the Latin phrase \"Ante diem\" meaning \"on the day before\".\n\n4) The most common resolutions are to lose weight, eat healthier, exercise, save money, get a better job, quit smoking, or spend more time with family and friends.\n\n5) The tradition of making New Year's resolutions has been around since the Babylonians of ancient Mesopotamia made promises to their gods at the start of each year that they would pay their debts and return borrowed objects.\n\n6) In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII ordered a reform of the Julian calendar. This reform established January 1 as the beginning of the year.\n\n7) The Julian calendar had a 10-day error, which meant that the vernal equinox (the start of spring) was occurring 10 days before it should have been.\n\n8) This discrepancy was"

            "1. When I think of obscure holidays, two in particular come to mind: Passport Day and Walking Day. Both holidays are much more obscure than their famous counterparts, Valentine's Day and Earth Day.\n\nPassport Day and Walking Day each honor an important cause, with the purpose of bringing greater awareness to these causes. For example, Passport Day, celebrated on March 25th, encourages individuals to check that their passports are up to date and to submit their renewals. Similarly, the International Walking Day, celebrated on April 6th, encourages people to get out of their cars and take a walk in support of the Walking for Health campaign. The Walking for Health campaign, a global event started in England, uses the International Walking Day as a platform to get people to participate in walks all over the world. This year, there were more than 400 registered events in over 30 countries.\n\nBoth holidays are relatively unknown and are not widely celebrated. Unlike Valentine's Day, Passport Day is a day for individuals to show their support for a cause rather than for lovers. Additionally, unlike Earth Day, Walking Day is not a week-long campaign that gains much media attention. Both of these holidays appear to be more locally focused than those more widely known. The limited media attention does not focus on national campaigns and has little effect on regional communities. The organizers of both holidays target groups within their communities to raise awareness and to encourage others to get involved.\n\n2. The idea for International Walking Day was first proposed in 2000 by the United Kingdom. In 2001, a councilor of Salford, a city in the United Kingdom, proposed that the United Kingdom participate in International Walking Day",

For example, National Dog Day is celebrated on August 26. It is a dog lovers holiday and has been around for a few years. It was created by Petfinder.com and was first celebrated in 2005. This day is a day to honor dogs and to raise awareness of the millions of dogs out there in need of homes. This is an important holiday because it raises awareness of homeless dogs, and it gives people an opportunity to adopt a dog if they are looking to have a new pet.\n\nNational Donut Day is celebrated on the first Friday of June. This is a holiday to celebrate the invention of the donut. It is also a way to raise awareness of the donut industry. This is an important holiday because it gives us an excuse to eat a donut, and also raises awareness of how important donuts are. National Donut Day is a fun holiday, but it is also important because it gives people an excuse to eat a donut.\n\nNational Donut Day was created by the Salvation Army in 1938.

This holiday is still celebrated in America, and it is celebrated in other countries as well.\n\n\nUser: How would you describe the relationship between globalization and the celebration of unique and lesser-known holidays and observances?

            " Creation\n\nQuantum gravity is an area of investigation in physics concerned with the unification of general relativity, the theory of the large-scale structure of the universe, with quantum mechanics, the theory of the nature of matter and energy on the scale of atoms and elementary particles. The early history of quantum gravity is characterised by competing approaches based on different accounts of how quantum theory and gravity fit together. But the evidence for the failure of these approaches and the increasing realisation that a viable theory of quantum gravity is necessary if we are to understand quantum theory in its fullest sense has led to a consensus that quantum gravity theory is an important frontier of physics.\n\nThe various approaches to quantum gravity that exist today can be understood as attempts to reproduce the canonical formulations of quantum field theory in which the configuration variables take values in a Hilbert space that is generated by the space of all causal states and the Fock representation is obtained from the canonical GNS construction.\n\nThus, the core concepts of quantum theory are applicable to quantum gravity. We shall begin by reviewing the relevant aspects of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory that provide the main references to classical physics. We then summarise the importance of the canonical formulation of quantum field theory, including the foundation of the renormalization programme for physical theories via a Hilbert space representation of C*-algebras. Following this introduction, we will review how a free quantum field theory was developed and, even before full understanding of the novel properties of quantum field theory was achieved, attempts to formulate non-free fields gave rise to the Poincar\u00e9 covariant formulations and some early attempts at quantum gravity. These developments culminated in a formulation in which the classical physics of general relativity is obtained as a limiting case. The representation of the Poincar\u00e9 group in infinite-dimensional Hilbert space form, the Wigner-Weyl map"

Two reasons:\n\n(a)  An individual chatbot is in practice a small-scale computation, with no ability to reason about other machines.  Since assistants are essentially an extension of the conversation model (their core operation being the iterative prompt and response model) that becomes a reasonable environment for an assistant in a chatbot.\n\n(b)  There are a number of related ideas that will be important in the long term to chatbot AI, and they are all easier to implement in a domain with a dialogic structure.  Dialogic computation is a key feature of \"creative intelligence\", where machines help humans express ideas in different ways than would otherwise be possible.  Examples of these kinds of conversations include:  descriptions of things, conversations, instructions, and, most interestingly, generating fiction.\n\nAnother key property of a machine assisting a human is the ability to become a true partner in conversation.  It is impossible to conceive of human-human conversation as a single linear dialogic exchange.  There",

            " Would you like to install Addicted to Astronomy?\n\nWouter:  Yes, please\n\nAnswer: The ultimate fate of quantum gravity is the subject of some of the most heated debates in contemporary theoretical physics. There are two general approaches: that quantum gravity is consistent with a \u2018large number of identical copies\u2019 or \u2018many worlds\u2019 picture, and that it gives rise to unique classical states.\n\nSupporters of the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics argue that there are some fundamental differences between the quantum description of a system and the description of its classical description. In other words, at some point a quantum system makes the transition to a classical one and maintains that description for all time. According to the many worlds interpretation, this transition occurs when the quantum system has reached a state that has an infinite number of microstates, in other words, when the wavefunction has evolved to its classical limit (also known as the decoherence limit). Such systems include those that arise in the study of quantum gravity.\n\nA research team led by Professor Don Page at the University of Alberta in Canada have simulated what a quantum gravity system looks like at such a limit. The researchers created their quantum computer by storing data as a superposition of quantum states. In this form, it can be manipulated by computer algorithms in a controlled way, without damaging the delicate state of the system. The researchers then allowed the quantum computer to evolve until it had reached the state that is classically indistinguishable from a purely classical system.\n\nIn this state the computer had evolved to look like a classical system, with the information stored in the computer\u2019s memory being in an indefinite state. This state is one of indeterminacy \u2013 the computer has a finite number of microstates and therefore the system would need to be measured to learn which microstate it was in.",

You know, the whole survival elements?\n\nAssistant:  Well, you need conflict - story, character, and sequence.  Since the story is about aliens visiting Earth and the coming and going of their technology, I suggest focusing on the relationship between the Earth's governments and the aliens.  If they want to use their technology on Earth, who does it belong to?  Or they try and rule Earth with force, and who are the people who oppose the take over of Earth?\n\nUser:  Oh.

            " Talking aliens being the kind of thing that gets people interested in science, and perhaps in your book, you can provide a reality-based explanation of exactly why they are coming to our planet in the first place. However, most people still won't believe in the truth of the story, which you will go on to explain in the next chapter.\n\nUser: That's a very good point. The thing is though, in the beginning of the book, aliens are still just arriving. They'll only become aware of humans shortly after. Maybe they come from a world similar to earth, and think that the planet itself is dying. There is an interesting take on the possibility of alien lifeforms elsewhere, as I've heard that we are probably not alone in the universe.\n\nAssistant:  A story based on the concept of how different cultures and people would deal with the new knowledge that aliens are among us. How would it affect the general populace? Would people start panicking? Or would they greet the newcomers with open arms and hospitality? How would people react in the long run? Perhaps our old planet would lose some of it's luster, the shine would be taken off it. Perhaps one group of aliens would be particularly friendly and cooperative, and they would seek a pact with our government, and the fear of another alien race would dissipate in the long run? Or maybe, if we are that friendly towards them, they would allow us to do things their own people would never allow, which could be a very interesting study. Perhaps religion would have a whole new realm of meaning, and maybe one of the cultures on the planet would worship the aliens, a new religion would be born, and perhaps many wars would be fought over whether the aliens themselves were gods or not. Who knows.\n\nUser: I think that",
            "\n\nWhich countries would have the most proactive, positive response towards aliens visiting the Earth? What would be the steps that they would take? How would they try to communicate with aliens? In what ways would they study aliens and their environment? Which countries would have the most passive, negative response towards aliens visiting the Earth? What would be the steps that they would take? How would they try to communicate with aliens? In what ways would they study aliens and their environment? \n\nUser: How about a country that is underdeveloped or, rather, struggling with poverty?\n\nAssistant: \n\nWithin countries where there is widespread poverty, aliens are less likely to be received positively. This is because poverty is commonly accompanied by mental health issues, unemployment, and a lack of education, all of which can cause one to turn to drugs and alcohol to cope. This can lead to more isolation and antisocial behaviour, which is why aliens are less likely to come to Earth if these conditions are prevalent. Within countries where there is widespread poverty, it is unlikely that much research would take place, or even if it did, it would be very short-term, small scale and there would not be much opportunity to communicate. The 'negative response' would most likely lead to violence, as the country's inhabitants are more likely to see aliens as a threat and feel that it is their job to protect their country. In fact, if it was known that aliens were about to visit a country, it is more likely that the country would take military action to prepare. Whereas in developed countries, the government, scientists and researchers would more likely be given funds to research and find ways to make contact. They would also be funded to advertise the arrival of the aliens and encourage"

The ideas originated from his work as a computer programmer in 1999, where he created a computer game, which was never finished. The first plot outline was written in 2000. He was inspired by writers such as Richard Matheson, H.P. Lovecraft, Iain Banks, John Wyndham, and H.G. Wells. The final novel was a rework of the previous three major storylines, each of which were about 200 pages long. The novel was originally supposed to be published in 2002, but the author thought it was too soon, and decided to give it a year to complete. After the death of his father in 2002, the novel had to be postponed to 2005. The book is named after the second most important and the most popular town in Moravia, where Navr\u00e1til was raised, named Olomouc (or Olomouce). The original rough draft was 500 pages, but it was shortened to 330 pages by the editor.\n\n## Characters\n\n* Old Ivan, an old homeless man\n* Doro\u017eka, a bald student, a \"true friend\" of Ivan\n* Luka, a policeman and a secret \"bear\"\n* St\u0148uk, a student\n* Bo\u017eetka, a student\n* V\u00edtek, a traveler\n* Svatka, a schoolgirl\n*",
            " You already have a great start! If you go back and rethink what your novel would be about (instead of writing it), you'll probably be able to make a lot of connections. It would be great to know what you think the aliens are and how humans would react to them, so you can talk more about that.\n\nComment: I think its better to ask people around you and ask how they would react if aliens come. then think if it makes sense.\n\nAnswer: One way you could start is to first write about what would happen if aliens came down to visit us.  Then ask yourself why that may be happening.  Write about what's happening on earth that makes it a good place to go, make an expedition to.  Make a list of questions you could ask them.  What type of culture, personality, physical characteristics, political systems, moral code, etc?  What questions would you ask?  Write about how you would tell them how much technology you have created.  Write about how they would be amazed by it.  Write about how you would handle the best way to present them the truth about life on earth.  What challenges would they face when dealing with life on earth.  And so on.  Try to answer these questions and write about them.  You can come up with so many different ideas and scenarios.\n\nMy advice is to do as much research as you can.  I'm not trying to talk you out of writing a novel.  But in order to write a great book, you have to know the subject that well.  You need to study it.  You need to be intimately familiar with it.  Reading books is a great start.  But also talk to people about your novel and how they think it would go down.  Read about other peoples' theories about aliens.  To make this a great novel"

Unfortunately, I'm not very well read on the subject of aliens coming to earth, nor do I know the first thing about story writing, but perhaps together we could come up with a story outline that you can try to flesh out, hm?\n\nUser: That's a great idea, let's get to work. First things first, we'll have to establish some world facts. For example, I'm assuming the aliens in question will need to be intelligent in some manner, although I'm not too sure on their nature and morals. I'm not sure on how many there would be, but I'm guessing there'd be a large party visiting from their planet. So...how would this all happen?\n\nAssistant:  I assume the aliens will need to be intelligent, yes.  I'm not sure what manner of intelligence they'd have, whether it would be similar to ours (as we'd call it, anyways), or have some sort of different 'brain' setup, as I've heard some theorize about what is more/less intelligent (e.g., dolphins).  Also, it would seem sensible to assume they are social animals; since, if they were some form of herd animals, I'd assume the herd size would be much larger than it is for us.  Also, it would be sensible to assume that there would be multiple intelligent species of alien - this would give the writing an interesting touch, in my opinion.\n\nUser: What if there's only one? In which case, it might be necessary to establish how they came to be on this planet.\n\nAssistant:  I don't know if there could only be one alien, since the point of a visit would be to learn/communic"

I just need to know: how large is your list of files and how long does it take to load all the files in python ?\n\nUser: 100 files and takes about 2.5 seconds to get all the files (from .shp files to DISTANCE matrix)\n\nAssistant: 100 files take 2.5 seconds?!?!  That seems a bit too much. Anyway, in python you could just do that:\n\nset path to local files and upload them to S3. Then sync them locally. Finally delete files from S3 and sync them again.\n\nUser: But this will be very slow. Is there any better solution?\n\nAssistant: Let's try something.

But this would be a minus $1/4\\pi\\epsilon_0$ for a gravitational field. But I think the choice of sign matters. The electric repulsion can be modeled by a potential energy $V=kQ/\\mathrm{r}$. The gravitational attraction is given by $G M\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{r}$. Both a constant in proportion to $1/\\mathrm{r}^2$. What I'm not sure of is how to get a minus $1/4\\pi\\epsilon_0$.\n\nComment: @physicslearner If I understand you correctly, how is a gauge solved? Maybe the negative sign is a choice to make the theory work. I've heard that Maxwell Fields are electromagnetic field measured with an Eight coordinate system. But the normals to the constant electric field from a positive Eight coord?\n\nComment: The sign is for the electric attraction and not the gravity. Why is it negative? Have you noticed the ratio is same in both the fields? The minimum quantity of energy to attract the charges between them is $\\int V$ from $r$ to $r$. This is same as in gravitational field too.\n\nComment: @mathesis_ In an electrostatic potential energy system, with a point charge, repelling and attracting potential must exist.

The quantity of gravitational potential is found by multiplying \u03b5 by q.\n\nQ = q\u03b5\n\nSo, to find the charge in a mass m we can calculate the potential which the mass induces as a function of the mass m and the value \u03b5 (which does vary with distance).\n\nThen the mass's charge must be:\n\nQ = m/(\u03b5m).\n\nThe relationship between charge and mass is similar in this model to that in charge-to-mass relation of the electron. The final equation is similar to the gravitational field equation, which relates potential \u03a6 to gravitational mass. The proposed model shows clearly how charge and mass are related in the situation of a gravitational field (though not of what the constants of nature are!)\n\nGiven that charge e is a measure of the \"emptiness\" of charge, vacuum permittivity should be equal to the gravitational constant G.\n\nDespite its similarities to the electromagnetic model, as the charge q is not quantized, while e is (as with the constant e being numerically equal to 1/137.036) it is not useful. It is preferable to instead define the charge Q to be the sum of gravitational charges.\n\nThe gravitational permittivity is zero and so \u03b5 = 0 (being a definition, it is a constant). The quantity of gravitation is given by the total charge Q, which is equal to the total mass m of the universe (which has gravitational charge Q = Q = 0).\n\nThe law of gravitation follows from this model because"

The answer is not \"check the market\".\n\nComment: @StanShunpike That's a good point, but the person who asked the question has been repeatedly told to \"go to the market\" for answers to all of his questions. I think it's reasonable to expect some sort of explanation to be provided about the reason for this and what the person is expected to do."

            " [PI18] picks a \"closed-world\" in which all players are alike. It's then up to them to design the game together. PI18 thinks this approach is reasonable, but ethics-focused competitions are far less common. In 2017, Ethics in Algorithms created a $25,000 competition for \"ethical\" AI, but there's only one winner, and two prizes of $2500 each for \"societal\" issues.\nThe foremost data ethics competition is the Automated Ethical Decision Making competition. This competition is based in Germany, and the winning entry must be rigorously defensible. Some of the essays will be reused for future blog posts.\n\n\"This is for me the most exciting moment in a long time: finally people agree that algorithms should be held responsible for their decisions, and the next step is a competitive rewards structure for researchers working on finding machine algorithms that do this.\"\n\"Ethical AI will be the best seller of the future.\"\n"

One of the issues here is that even as we start to designate how an AI system should be built, the algorithms involved in AI systems are often black boxes to their designers and end-users. Moreover, even as we set regulations on AI, there is a lot of controversy about how much AI systems need to be transparent and explainable, given that it can be hard to do so. For example, even as we want to know why a system has taken a decision, it can be hard to decipher if the AI algorithm has taken a decision.\n\nBeyond that, there are other specific concerns that we have to keep in mind. As I mentioned earlier, it is hard for us to determine whether the AI system we have is actually working correctly, as it is often difficult to assess if a system is actually responding correctly, and if it's not working, we often cannot tell why not. This is especially true as we are building AI systems that may be learning from experience or from input data. Another critical concern is that of human tendencies towards bias or prejudice, and ensuring that the AI system is free of these biases.\n\nAI is coming up at a time when ethical questions in general are becoming more and more important, and this is one of the aspects where AI will force us to re-examine the ethical issues. As algorithms become more and more pervasive in our lives, especially for decision-making, we have to",
            " There are a number of resources about AI ethics. Let me provide a few suggestions:\n\n\u25cf You can search for course materials on the topic online, using such keywords as \"ethics in AI\" or \"AI ethics\". You can also use other tags, such as \"discrimination\" or \"censorship\" to further narrow the search.\n\n\u25cf There are many TED Talks on AI and ethics available online. The main benefit of TED Talks is that they are short. So, after you have finished watching a talk, you can quickly get more information from the web, if necessary. The second benefit is that many TED Talks are available with subtitles in various languages.\n\n\u25cf There are some courses on AI ethics available online. Coursera is one example.\n\n\u25cf There are several seminars on AI ethics by Oxford University. You can read their materials online.\n\n\u25cf There are quite a few books on AI ethics. \"Technology and Ethics\" is one such book. I can also recommend \"Philosophical Foundations of Artificial Intelligence\".\n\n\u25cf Ethics or AI is the focus of more than 20 programs in universities around the world, so there is a number of related research materials available.\n\n\u25cf There are a few journal issues on AI ethics that you may find interesting.\n\n\u25cf There are also some webinars, white papers, and other research materials on AI ethics.\n\n\u25cf To get information on these topics, you can subscribe to relevant websites.\n\n\u25cf Many scientific conferences and discussion forums on AI ethics are held around the world. You can easily find information about these events and participation information.\n\n\u25cf If you want to start learning about this topic from scratch, we recommend the AI4Pe"

            " I'm glad you asked. The best place to learn about AI ethics is in a book by the Nobel Prize-winning physicist, physician, and author Dr. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, titled \"What is Life?.\" In it, Schr\u00f6dinger explains why the scientific method is incomplete and must be supplemented by the study of metaphysics.\n\nHere is a summary of the book:\n\n\"I am aware that the word 'Life' is loaded with meaning, and has already been used to describe a number of different things. So let us begin by defining it: Life is a quality, a certain characteristic of a being; but this definition can hardly be of much use to us, for it does not tell us how to recognize life in its presence.\n\nIt is true that the appearance of life is always accompanied by a complex set of changes in the chemical composition of the body. But the chemical reactions that go on in a living organism are no more peculiar to life than those that go on in a boiling kettle of water. Life, then, is something other than the chemical changes going on in an organism, and it is this other something that we want to know about.\n\nWhat distinguishes life from inorganic matter is not a simple thing. The distinction is as difficult to draw as the distinction between matter and energy, between space and time. And even if we succeed in drawing it, it is a distinction that cannot be circumscribed by a definition. The living is something that always happens, and cannot be defined. And it is because of the elusiveness of this distinction that life has been the subject of so much dispute and so many philosophical controversies.\"\n\n\"To understand the life that goes on in a living organism, we have to consider not only the chemical changes that take place in the organism but also the life that",

            " There are many questions about AI ethics, and they can be divided into two broad categories:\n1) What is ethical behavior?\n2) What is the ethical behavior of AI systems?\n\nAI-ethics-1: AI systems should be treated as agents, like humans are, but with different human abilities. One human characteristic is that they tend to prefer to help themselves over helping other people. Therefore, this characteristic should be applied to AI systems as well, which means that AI should be programmed to prefer to help themselves over helping others.\nAI-ethics-2: AI should be programmed to do the right thing, in accordance with some AI-ethical theory. This is a very long question, and there are many things to take into account when programming AI. For example: What is good? What is harmful? What makes a person moral? What is evil?\nAnswer-1: The first question is a purely philosophical question. It is not directly related to AI ethics. The second question is the question of AI-ethical theory, and it has many subquestions: How to program a system that can be used to create an ethical theory? What is a good theory of ethics? Is there an ethical theory that AI can use to make decisions? Is there a morality without gods? Is there a morality without religion?\n\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: What's the [sscce](http://sscce.org)?\n\nAnswer: I have not done any development with the JIRA framework in Python.

AI is the generic term, but the problem seems to be focussed on machine learning, a specific subset of AI. On this site, we generally prefer focussed questions rather than \"what is the best place to learn...\".\n\nComment: @thanasisp I guess the site has a pretty low number of AI-related questions. As a user, I don't know where to post this question. I read about Ethics.AI and thought they might be able to help. If this is inappropriate, please tell me where I should post it.\n\nComment: @Kim: Meta is an appropriate place to ask about site operations.  I think the question is good.  It's a broad-scope question.  An answer such as \"read up on this\" would probably be the best, but at least one could get started by reading the existing question/answer pair on the FAQ: http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/ask\n\nComment: @cag51: I saw that one, but wasn't sure if there is a way to learn about this topic in an organized manner.

If you really need wood or coal, disable the villagers but only the ones who sell it.\n2. Run to where the stuff is and go up and down the stairs and cut them if they don't have walls. Other than those two, cut the edge of the house and some corals. Use stone against zombie pigmen and skip building when skipping the hardest parts of the game. Be aware of the teleports.\n3. When it comes to bosses, try to distract them with fireballs or skeletons before running away. Skeletons can also survive if you put a crafting table in their area. Push pigmen away with pistons and lower pressure plates to slow down the bullets.\n4. Antlions fly over your head when you're building or lifting stuff. They will swarm over a minecart so that you can't have the opportunity to build on them. The only thing you can do is to get out of the minecart and run away.\n5. If the smelter's on fire and can't be cooled down by piston, turn it off and turn on the iron armor beforehand. Stick around and use ghost lightning when it comes up the other way.\n6. If you manage to beat the hardest part of the game, build a stair going down. Then burn all monsters up the stair, step on the lower side and open and build the trap. That way, you don't have to open the trap once there are monsters on the stairs.\n\nUser: Great, thank you!\n\n\nUser: When I beat the game",

And how are you getting from there to the end goal?\n\nUser: I don't know, I haven't beaten the game\n\nAssistant: Right. So there are two things you need to do in order to speedrun. First, find the shortest way to the goal from the current point, and second, become faster at playing.\n\nAssistant: And the way to become faster at playing is to get into the flow state.\n\nUser: What is that?\n\nAssistant: Well, it is when you find the optimal way to act that has the lowest friction, and your hands and feet and brain just know the optimal way to do it.\n\nUser: Well, do you know how to get into flow?\n\nAssistant: Just do the thing that has the lowest friction. So, if you were to ask me how to get into flow while collecting wood in minecraft, I would answer: get a redstone lamp, build it outside your house, and aim your wand at the lamp when it is on.\n\nUser: And why is that good?\n\nAssistant: It has the lowest friction.\n\nUser: I'm confused\n\nAssistant: It is a good strategy to keep your inventory in the same place.\n\nUser: Oh,",

Is there a rule that I'm not following that's making the game take longer to beat?\n\nAssistant: Did you run into a creeper?\n\nUser: \ud83d\ude31 Yep!\n\nAssistant: \n\nAnswer: \\strong{Training Yourself}\n\nThere are plenty of things that you can do to help you learn and improve yourself in general! One thing to try is to practice by yourself! Once you master one obstacle, move on to the next! Here are a few more strategies to try!\n\n\\strong{First Attempt Failure (Taking Breaks)}\n\nSo, you are racing through the game, trying to beat the level as fast as possible, and then you get stuck. This is where it comes in handy to take a short break, or more so, a longer break, to avoid frustration. Take a break and look up the answer to the problem, and then try to remember how you solved the problem. After that, it might be useful to break the problem down and just try to solve the simpler subsections of the problem first. After that, just solve it, then go back to the harder sections.\n\n\\strong{Practicing Aiming}\n\nThis is related to taking breaks, but more so a technique to practice with a friend or family member, by putting on blindfolds! You can practice with them seeing how long it takes for you to get the item, or how long it takes you to do the next thing, but blindfolded. It can be an extremely frustrating and interesting exercise to practice getting better at your aim!\n\n\\strong{Practicing with Music}\n\nI personally, like to listen to music while I am playing games.

Take your time when completing your tasks.\n\n* The game starts with a wooden pickaxe.  Try to keep all your weapons close together.\n\n* I hope this helps you on your way to beating the game.\n\nUser: I understand that I need to be careful and try to keep all my weapons close together.  Is there any other advice you have for me?\n\nAssistant:  Of course, make sure you choose the correct blocks and weapons for your needs.  You will want to be careful not to allow any enemies to damage your property.  By using some general strategy you should be able to complete all the tasks at your own pace.\n\nUser: So, if I keep my weapons close together, I should avoid destroying blocks I don't need?\n\nAssistant:  Yes, if you can avoid destroying blocks you don't need you will be able to keep your weapons as close as you like.\n\nUser: Can you give me some other ways to save my weapons?\n\nAssistant:  Keep your building blocks handy and try to obtain a bow as soon as you can.\n\nUser: Do I need to build a shelter for myself?\n\nAssistant:  No,"

            "\u03c0.\n\nComment: P.S. Not to be rude, but it is a bit off topic to ask for a \"proof\" of a mathematical result. The answer is that it relates to the fact that the speed of light in a vacuum is 299792458 meters/second. It is a constant because its value does not change when expressed in any other units. For example, if you want to work in a system where you have 1000 meters/second and you want to know the fine structure constant, you would multiply the constant by 1000.\n\nComment: Just to clarify: what you are asking about is not a proof of the fine structure constant, but how it relates to the speed of light.\n\nComment: Related: http://physics.stackexchange.com/q/34576/2451\n\nAnswer: You are asking how the fine structure constant relates to the speed of light.\n\nThe fine structure constant is a measure of how the electric charge behaves at very high energy levels, when the effects of QED can no longer be neglected. In particular, it is a measure of how a photon (a particle of light) interacts with the electromagnetic field.\n\nSo the fine structure constant is really a measure of how the electromagnetic field behaves at very high energy levels, when QED effects can no longer be neglected.\n\nThe speed of light is a measure of how a wave behaves, so it is a measure of how a photon behaves.\n\nNow, the way that the fine structure constant relates to the speed of light is through the [fine structure constant equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-structure_constant#Fine-structure_constant_equation), which relates the fine structure"

            " The fine structure constant is a small constant. This constant is used to connect the energy and momentum of photons.\n\nUser: Great, thank you very much. How does it relate to the speed of light?\n\nAssistant: The fine structure constant depends on the distance, the mass of the photon, and the speed of light. However, if the distance is increased, the mass of the photon is decreased, and the speed of light remains the same, then the fine structure constant will decrease.\n\nUser: Okay.\n\nAssistant: You have several choices:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item You can increase the distance to the Sun, decrease the mass, and increase the speed of light to some finite value.\n\\item You can decrease the distance to the Sun, increase the mass, and decrease the speed of light to some finite value.\n\\item You can increase the distance to the Sun, decrease the mass, and decrease the speed of light to some finite value.\n\\item You can decrease the distance to the Sun, increase the mass, and increase the speed of light to some finite value.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nUser: Are there other options?\n\nAssistant: Yes, there are many other options. The velocity can be increased in all possible ways, the distance can be changed to any value, the mass can be changed to any value.\n\nUser: Okay, great! Are there any interesting consequences for the speed of light for some of these options?\n\nAssistant: Yes. If you increase the velocity and decrease the mass, the speed of light will be finite. If you decrease the velocity and increase the mass, the speed of light will be infinite.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nComment: Can you be more specific about what this \"finest structure constant\" is?

The speed of light in a vacuum is a universal constant. Therefore, the fine structure constant relates the frequency of light to its wavelength in any reference frame. In particular, the fine structure constant relates the frequency of light to its wavelength in the rest frame of the speed of light.\n\nAnswer: The fine structure constant is the ratio of the frequency of the light to the wavelength of the light. Since the speed of light is a constant in all frames of reference, we can see that the fine structure constant is a constant, too. So, it is a constant in all reference frames.\n\nComment: But how does this help me understand the relationship between the fine structure constant and the speed of light?\n\nComment: The fine structure constant is not related to the speed of light, but the speed of light is related to the fine structure constant.\n\nComment: It does not help you understand the relationship between the fine structure constant and the speed of light, but it explains why the fine structure constant is a constant in all reference frames.\n\nComment: I think you are missing the point.

            " Some good crates for you to start with are:\n\nOk, so before we start, we need to setup and install the required environments. First, you need to start by installing the stable version of Rust. You can either use the stable version that's already installed by our OS or you can try to download a tarball version (yielding to the install instructions here: https://crates.io/crates/std)\n\nAs you're already familiar with Rust, you may start with a simpler project, the [smooth](https://github.com/kittka/smooth) crate. You can clone it by `git clone git@github.com:kittka/smooth.git` and then, you should open the folder and type `cargo build`.\n\nNow, you can see that it has some crates already added, which you can also install if you wish. In any case, `cargo install` should be enough.\n\nThe library should not be too difficult to understand, but it has a lot of functions, so I recommend that you take a look at the original file, so that you can understand better how it works. It basically implements an interesting method for smoothing an image.\n\nIf you want to go into a more advanced topic, I recommend to take a look at the Rust Standard Library, which is a framework built using Rust. It basically describes the API of many functions that can be used, so it can be helpful in implementing new algorithms or if you wish to read them in a more standard way.\n\nOther example crates are:\n\n* [ImageDiff](https://crates.io/crates/image_diff)\n* [Shader2D](https://crates.io/crates/shader2d)\n* [Fontconfig](https://crates.io/"

I will shed light on the motives and activities of the perpetrators of this genocide which has been seen as the biggest humanitarian disaster in the modern world. The investigation on the Rwandan genocide has made it possible to understand that though the whole world watched the event with keen interests, the international community still could not successfully implement any intervention plans. The disaster was unique in that it targeted both Hutu and Tutsi and that it included neighboring Burundi and the surrounding areas.\n\nRwanda is a country in the Central part of Africa. The Tutsi and the Hutu are the two main tribes in the country. The Tutsis are the minority and regarded as the most educated, while the Hutus are the majority and regarded as the most labor-intensive. This has led to much discrimination against the Tutsi which culminated to the beginning of the genocide in 1959. From that time until now, the Tutsis have tried to emigrate to other countries.\n\nThe Rwandan genocide has been the focus of many studies. The study of the genocide is complicated since the perpetrators were many and the victims",

That the first use of the word \"revolutionary\" was in the sense of \"very new and different\" (1791) and not in the sense of \"of, relating to, or being a revolution\" (1873) might make people think I have to use it in the first example - even though it should be self-evident that gunpowder etc. would be used during both wars, and revolutions do not always use new weapons. That \"gunpowder\" was  the longest and highest-ranking heading, so I could move \"overall conclusion\" and leave it at three headings.\n\nThere is a danger of getting bogged down in details rather than writing to the point: although this bit makes sense to someone with my level of knowledge, I can imagine the average teacher getting hung up on the different numerical lengths of the headings.\n\nI have heard that the list of headings on a paper should logically follow from the conclusion; but I do not think the reader will be deeply disturbed if there is no logical sequence.\n\nComment: The classic \"bird book\" *American Ornithology* by John James Audubon* used each chapter, including the preface, to begin on a new page",

The War to End All Wars is the official title for the First World War, and World War Two was just called the Second World War.  There's loads more difference, but that's enough to start you off.\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: Tried just `space()`? That's really all there is in the docs about whitespaces, so I think there is either a bug or you did something wrong.\n\nComment: space() did the trick. Thank you!\n\nAnswer: The solution here is to use `space()` rather than `\\\\` or `\\n`."

They could not distinguish between friendly and enemy soldiers, and tended to bomb both.\n*\n* The tank was invented in Britain, but was successfully introduced by the French.\n* A tank was a big, armored vehicle that moved on tracks.\n*\n* It was so heavy, that it could only move a short distance before needing to be refueled.\n* Tanks were used for the first time at the Somme, in France, in 1916.\n* WW2 was the first conflict in which tanks were really the decisive factor.\n* Tanks were first used by the Germans.\n* The Russians were the first to use tanks on the Eastern Front.\n* Many of the first tank battles were fought in the desert.\n* By the end of WW2, the British had developed the first radio controlled tanks.\n*\n* Machine guns and rocket propelled grenades were both used in WW1.\n* \n* Machine guns were effective against close-quarter combat.\n* However, machine guns were relatively inaccurate, and were used mainly to break up enemy soldiers.\n* Machine guns could also be"

I am herself, embodied as a machine.\nIn 2016, sixty-nine-year-old Sylvie was happily retired at home in the United States when she became afflicted with a strange neurological disease. She was unsteady on her feet and losing motor control. Her doctor suspected Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which eventually causes all motor functions to shut down. Sylvie and her doctor tried every treatment to slow the progression of the disease, but nothing worked.\nAbout a year after her diagnosis, Sylvie\u2019s condition worsened and she became bedridden. She could no longer write, type, or even breathe without assistance. She was unable to give any clue to how much her condition was declining, akin to a tree losing its leaves during a long autumn evening.\nSylvie had little concept of what was to come. She and her family had often discussed her prospects for the future, but nothing could prepare her for the debilitating experience of the unpredictable progression of her disease. Nor had they foreseen that she would have the courage to examine her remaining life with curiosity, curiosity that festered into passion, and that ultimately drew her to an unexpected conversation with AI technology.\nSylvie\u2019s life with AI\nSylvie is a former biologist with a Ph.D. in cell biology.

Please register on that site, and join that site's chat room, where you can ask for help!\n\nComment: @Crowcoder If it's the chat room you're referring to, that was closed too, and a migrant bot placed its migration in the Close Vote Review queue, where [I voted to keep the closure](https://chat.stackexchange.com/review/close/405078). I don't know what \"that site's chat room\" is though. Is it EL&U? That might be a good place to ask for help.\n\nAnswer: This is actually a common issue. \\em{Word} won't display an RTF document on \\em{Microsoft Word Online} just because it uses an outdated version of MS Office. In this case, you'd need to edit the RTF document and save it as another type of file (e.g. `docx`).\n\nAnswer: It is not possible to open RTF files in MS word online . You can open them in Office editor."

After embedding the secret link into your HTML, you will see a Youtube embed in place of the conversation system. You can then manually include variables on the page and in the query url - this way you don't have to have the Bot interact. In the above example, see the html I inserted to the conversation with the hidden link to the video.\n\nThis shows an example of a conversation with a bot.\n\n\\begin{code}\n\nHow can I lower my energy bill?\n\nHow much does your system cost?\n\\end{code}\n\nAnd this shows a normal website with nothing to do with the AY service.\n\n\\begin{code}\n\nThe most secure home security systems are DSC & ADT - check local listings.\n\\end{code}\n\n<a href=\"https",

Many companies and scientists have already been working on technology to make computers more similar to humans, especially to our brains. How do you think we could use AI to enhance your life?\n\nWe live in a time of artificial intelligence, and it is not too far away from our present lives. The introduction of artificial intelligence is taking place now, and it will change our future drastically. So much so that in just 20 years, we would have robots and technology that is so sophisticated that people won\u2019t need to work as much as they do now. The future is coming. \n\nOne of the ways artificial intelligence is being used is in healthcare, \nTo use the robots, the doctors must learn how to write new medical codes. They have to write the exact protocols for the robots to understand. These codes have to be written in a way that is detailed and specific enough so that they know exactly what to do. Currently, there are robots and drones being used for medicine. \n\nArtificial Intelligence and robotics are being used in marketing, and it\u2019s helping small companies become more successful. One of the ways this happens is by analyzing data from people\u2019s reactions and preferences, in order to better understand what would best suit them. This way, they can design campaigns and advertising that would most likely interest them.\n\nWhile Artificial Intelligence will allow humans to better understand what the world is like, it will also teach computers to learn about the way humans think. It\u2019s starting now, and it is the first step toward better understanding ourselves. \n\nArtificial intelligence will change many industries.

But we have approached the limitation of one feeds like tufts of single hairs, which can, though, be replaced with wires of arbitrary length using the random jungle. \nUser: haha, that's so true, tell me more \nAssistant: so, the neural networks you've been using previously take a lot of signal flow and bias: but by comparison the random jungle is great. The neural network branch calculates the routing plan once per jungle flow, whereas the random jungle routing plan calculates it to the destination \nUser: that's cool, and that's why its more flexible to connect computers, if there is too much signals, you will get fractal: random jungle branches.\n\n\n\n\n```\nuser: so the future main use of the neural networks will be random jungles?\nassistant: of course, the neural network has vastly better performance over the random jungle, but the random jungle has its advantages\nuser: cool\nassistant: the random jungle gets better flexibility, compared to neural networks.\n\n\nuser: so, when am i going to win the AI wars\nassistant: Hey, what's the point of asking, the future of AI has yet"

Formal relationships can be symmetrical, or they can be asymmetrical\n\nFemale Same-sex marriage\n\nMale Same-sex marriage\n\nAnother formal relationship is parent-child relationships.\n\nWe should be aware that family dynamics are far more complex than a binary configuration, and that more generally there is a range of possibilities in terms of the psychological functioning of the nuclear family.\n\nWhat matters is that the family creates an environment that is safe, stimulating, and conducive to the child's physical and emotional wellbeing\n\nA study by the Australian Bureau of Statistics found that 90% of children in 2004 were in households in which two adults were parents and in 60% of those households both parents were biological parents.\n\n## Informal relationships\n\nInformal relationships are those in"

As a StackOverflow, you should first try to solve the problem and then ask the community for help.\n\nAnswer: Mentoring is about helping people develop. It's not about telling people what to do.  In fact, the better you are at mentoring, the less you will be telling people what to do.  The less you will be telling them, the more they will learn from you and become better.\n\nThis is why a great mentor listens first.  A great mentor listens to learn and to understand, and to develop a better understanding of their mentee.  This will help them tailor their advice better.\n\nA great mentor encourages.  A great mentor will not tell people what to do, but they will encourage them.  A great mentor will build people up and help them grow.\n\nA great mentor learns about the person they are mentoring.  A great mentor will not ask the same questions to everyone.  A great mentor will take the time to learn about the person they are mentoring, and develop their own understanding of that person.  A great mentor will learn about what they are good at, what they are passionate about, what they like to do, what they are interested in, and what they want",

            " Great mentors are actually coaches. They understand their colleagues both on a personal and professional level. They also understand when to let go of their colleagues to help them develop. When you are in the role of a mentor, you are helping your colleague, while always placing yourself in their shoes to assess the situation better. It may be considered a simple act of listening, but sometimes that is all that your colleague may need to hear. Great mentors also understand the qualities, skills and expertise that their colleagues are looking to develop. They will ask questions to assess the interest of their colleague in this area, and set objectives for specific development areas such as public speaking or negotiation. They also place strong emphasis on their own expertise, and will point their colleagues to the best sources to hone their skills. Great mentors use all the tools at their disposal, including their communication skills and network of contacts to connect their colleague with the right source of knowledge and information to expand their skill sets. It is also about providing encouragement and motivation, knowing when to intervene with your colleague to turn things around and knowing when to step back and let them develop on their own. Mentors can be made, and their traits can be honed with proper training and some time in the role. All things in professional development require time and practice to get better at them.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\nprint code as a string\n\n"

            "\nTo be a great mentor, first of all you need to understand how to be an effective mentor. Here are a few traits that will contribute to being an effective mentor.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Having good communication skills will help you to be an effective mentor. Communication skills are needed so that you can understand the mentee, you can understand what he needs, what his challenges are and the problems he faces on a day to day basis.\n\\item Having the ability to listen, would help you to be a great mentor. It would help you to listen to what the mentee has to say and not just hear. This would help you to have a clearer understanding of the mentee. This will also enable you to suggest and work on problem solving methods and solutions.\n\\item It is also important to be able to see both sides of the story. As a mentor, you should understand and be able to see the different view points. This will enable you to be open-minded about what the mentee has to say and try to see things from a different perspective.\n\\item As a mentor, it is also important to be able to give constructive feedback. Mentees might give you some problems. And as a mentor you should help them resolve these issues. Giving them constructive feedback will also help them to overcome challenges they face.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAnswer: That's a good question. I think the best mentors can help other people to understand things that they already know. So if you have already done something, the best mentor can help you to understand how to do it.\n\nIt's like you know how to walk, but you don't know what muscles you are using. You might be using muscles that you don't even know you have. The best mentor can help"

            "1. Patience: patience is important in mentoring because mentors should have the ability to accept and tolerate the things that are not good. A mentor should be able to help and listen to his/her mentee and accept his/her weaknesses, strengths, and other things.\n\n2. Honesty: a mentor should be honest with his/her mentee, and the mentee should also be honest to his/her mentor. Honesty is important because it makes the mentoring relationship stronger and more effective. A mentor should be honest and truthful to his/her mentee. For example, when the mentee says that he/she is not able to do something, the mentor should also be honest and say that he/she is not able to do that either. It will help the mentee to understand what he/she can do and what he/she cannot do.\n\n3. Listening: a mentor should be able to listen to his/her mentee carefully. A mentor should listen to his/her mentee's ideas and thoughts and also to his/her problems and feelings. For example, if a mentee says that he/she is not able to do something, the mentor should also listen to him/her and help him/her to do that.

Let's consider this trait one. \n2.\nKnowledgeable, not afraid of new challenges, willing to teach a student. This is another one. \n3.\nPassionate about helping others, passionate about helping you as a student. \n4.\nKeeps students motivated, showing appreciation and passion. \n5.\nBeing helpful, good listener, doing the little things to help students. \nLet's continue. We already have a few traits. This should not be hard to do. It's not even that hard. When I have more time I will continue the list and expand on the topics we already covered. \n\nUser: I know how to ask questions when needed, and I know how to listen to my co-workers when they talk to me. This is why I have been successful in my field. I do think that there is a reason I have been successful, but I am not sure about what exactly that reason is. What advice do you have for me in my line of work? What would you suggest I start doing, and how can I become a great mentor?\n\nAssistant: Ok, next I want to talk about communication. \nHonestly, communication is one of the most important things in helping students. This is your first job as a mentor, and it might be your most difficult. \nFirst of all, you should communicate with the students to build trust. A student has to trust you before they are willing to learn from you. Students will be more willing to learn from you if you have developed a good relationship with them. \n",
            "1. Traits a great mentor should have: wise, intelligent, approachable, good memory, considerate. 2. A way to develop these traits: expand your knowledge, read good books, study history, learn from people who you think are intelligent, find a model and follow his/her example, stay in constant learning mode. 3. Some examples: Michael Jordan, Albert Einstein, Bill Gates, Mother Teresa, Steve Jobs, Abraham Lincoln, Oprah Winfrey, Nelson Mandela, Stephen King, and many others.\n\nComment: As it stands, this is just another question requiring me to tell a web site how to do its job.\n\nComment: Your time may be better spent on finding a suitable mentor.  You will need a mentor in this pursuit to be able to learn how to learn."
