            "\"GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) is a fictional character from Valve Corporation's Portal series.\"\n\nAs can be observed it makes incorrect assumptions at different points such as suggesting \"What is your favorite music genre?\" when there was no mention of music anywhere in the initial context. The model also tends to use same patterns for many questions which reduces its generalization capability. It shows some basic understanding of user preferences by choosing an appropriate suggestion given its prior knowledge on user interests. But fails if they were asked multiple times. In Figure \\ref{fig:assist} (b), (d)-(f), we see three instances where suggestions provided do not match with actual query. There have been other works which have looked into assistive dialogue generation\\cite{zhang2018personalizing}\\cite{xu2021generating}. Such models tend to overfit to training data and therefore perform poorly compared to state-of-the art text generators like BERT \\cite{devlin2019bert}, XLNet \\cite{yang2019xlnet} , ALBERT \\cite{lan2019albert} etc... Moreover these datasets suffer major limitations associated with lack of grounding between queries and generated answers and only evaluate performance based upon recall\\footnote{The task itself asks whether suggested answer matched with original intent without taking grammatical and semantic errors related issues into account.} and precision metric (which often doesn\u2019t align correctly with human evaluations). Thus developing more expressive and sophisticated assistants is still largely needed.\\\\ \\\\\nIn this work, our aim has been to develop next level personalised chat bots using deep learning methods to overcome above shortcomings present in similar systems proposed till date so far.

Also the idea that its impossible to achieve complete bliss may cause me to strive harder and eventually discover a way through meditation. This kinda sounds good already just saying what could happen from thinking these thoughts and making this choice to focus first on happiness which allows freedom and space for higher values such as self actualization to flourish rather then starting with misery to force people into an infinite struggle for survival before they can try to live life for their own benefit alone after years or centuries spent learning enough to be free enough to start caring for others instead of myself only forever stuck struggling with scarcity never reaching full potential or peace because our entire culture revolves around exploiting other peoples struggles. We should work towards giving everyone resources until we dont need to keep growing our economy.

Last but certainly not least; maybe these persons simply wish for a quick end?\n8. Some people do not see the point of living if everything has an opposite side (happiness vs sadness) which makes us forget the happy part when we get sad. So, since everyone gets hurt one way or another, they decide they had enough of suffering and try to avoid it by taking less time. However, I am against suicide and I do not recommend anyone take his/her life away.\n9. Someone who chooses to live only until he reaches a certain goal doesn\u2019t care too much about himself. He cares more about accomplishment than about self-preservation, which can lead him into trouble. For example, someone who wants a job badly won\u2019t stop working even after getting sick, because he thinks he needs to keep going until he lands that position. This kind of behavior puts pressure on yourself, and it\u2019s hard to maintain over a lifetime. In my opinion, choosing to"

Furthermore, we note two interesting phenomena observed throughout these experiments. Firstly, that it appears almost intuitive/common knowledge among human assessors to detect negative sentiment towards their counterpart through body language (e.g., tone of voice) more frequently than verbal cues like sighs which might seem surprising given that it would be even less obvious if no audio was available during interaction. Secondly, that although a majority felt empathy and positivity were best conveyed through body language alone, many said smiling and nodding also contributed significantly to portraying enthusiasm, friendliness and understanding. This further explains why incorporation of multi-modal signals has led to significant performance gains over baselines across most datasets. While future research could investigate ways to leverage such patterns learned from human-human interactions into effective design guidelines for conversational agents~\\footnote{This topic fits naturally under a larger umbrella referred to as User Awareness. More details on related work regarding User Awareness as well its challenges can be found in Section~\\ref{sec:discussion}}, we encourage interested practitioners to first focus primarily on improving underlying model architectures prioritizing both strong pretraining strategies~\\cite{dontmissthetraining} (via transfer learning from large-scale video/speech/text"

Do we need another security camera system now though, because the front door was opened without our knowledge when someone knocked on it? The last time someone tried breaking into our backyard gate after we went inside around dusk - it triggered our ADT monitored alarm siren so loudly it startled everyone here! Maybe a Nest Cam would be useful to add too if needed again... Or maybe it doesn\u2019t even matter anymore since our dog seems more vigilant these days? So, yes I think the first step might have to be some better lightbulb solutions in our bedrooms before anything else, followed by replacing an older kitchen ceiling fan unit that\u2019s making funny noises every time my husband opens/closes the cabinet above where its mounted\u2026 That would definitely feel nicer once completed too.. We love listening to music in different rooms of our home simultaneously whenever possible too; perhaps an upgraded multi-room Sonos sound system could be considered later? Now how much will this cost exactly do you estimate for all this? How many years do those bulbs last usually? Do they ever break easily or fail completely during usage over long periods? Which color lights (hues) would best complement my interior design decorating ideas right away then? Do I have enough room in our current power strip circuits and surge protector devices?\n\nAssistant: Okay.

And after several months on June 8th 1999 launched their site which provided relevant webpages faster than anyone else could. That's what led them become No#1 for everyone including students. Also they introduced \"Google Scholar\" to give users an access to research literature. In this way many students started using google as primary source. Now Google provides tools like Docs/ Sheets/ Slides /Gmail etc... Which helped millions of students to communicate with teachers & each others online and do collaborative work more easily and quickly without much paperwork.. And finally google gave free cloud storage called \"google drive\", which also proved to be useful among university level learners to keep track of their important files related to study purpose only.. These services alongwith their popular search engine has made them #1 in student mind. But if I ask who uses it less often? The reply will surely come \"Nobody\". It may seem very hard but we all know about those few exceptions out there where internet service is too poor and no other alternative option left apart from facebook. Even some countries banned Google.com because it became such powerful platform which allowed sharing everything across globe even at low speed connection, thus leading into censorship. There is a list of things google doesn't allow but its main reason is due to legal obligations, cyberbullying , hacking activities , phishing , child pornography and other serious criminal activity issues . As these activities are highly illegal anywhere, So governments try their best to restrict usage. Therefore we can say Google isn't accessible everywhere, and thats how google came down a bit compared to its past days. Other Search Engines tried their luck by giving tough competition through"

They started out with an initial investment from Andy Bechtolsheim who gave them $100,000 dollars for their project which he called BackRub because it analyzed backlinks to determine how important websites were. The name changed later to Google after googol (a mathematical term) but this wasn\u2019t until 1999. In August 1995, Yahoo! became one of the first major commercial web directories. It had been launched just four months earlier in January 1994. By June 1996, there were already more than 50 million pages indexed by Yahoo!. However, Yahoo! didn\u2019t have its own search engine so it used WebCrawler to index all these sites. This meant that users would be redirected away from Yahoo! if they wanted to visit another site listed within the directory. As such, Yahoo! decided to create its own search engine using AltaVista\u2019s API. At the time, Altavista was considered the best search engine available. Soon afterwards, Lycos also began offering its own search service powered by Infoseek. These two new services quickly gained popularity among internet users. But then came Google. With its innovative approach to indexing the entire World Wide Web, Google soon surpassed even the most established players like Yahoo!, MSN Search and Ask Jeeves. Today, Google has become synonymous with online searching. Its market share stands at around 63% worldwide. That means nearly every second person uses Google to find what they want online.

We therefore propose a system for collecting annotations that allows us to construct a dataset containing comments which consistently reflect two key properties necessary for training an SRS model: \\emph{(i)} the text needs to adhere to scientific discourse norms; and \\emph{(ii}) it has to contain certain features allowing future researchers to identify flaws that are due to lacking expertise from the users themselves rather than the chatbot itself.\n\nThe remainder of our paper focuses on design aspects that help to ensure both properties when designing interfaces in such online education systems. With our proposed annotation process we hope to build up a data set that enables research into teaching systems like chabots, bots or agents better understand how humans react to them.\nTo provide generalizable results, we use several common AI-chat programs with various interfaces including the open source ones JABOCA and ChatScript2~\\cite{Hendrix_et_al_.2014}. For creating the datasets, we conducted several qualitative user studies. An analysis based on social psychological perspectives allowed the identification of further indicators for evaluation purposes. The results show that current chatbots do indeed allow for conversations beyond simple Q/A style interactions but also identified a number of shortcomings by the participants leading to misinterpretation and frustration. To address these issues, we present design guidelines based on existing literature on interface design principles used for programming language learning tools combined with empirical insights derived by"

It seems quite reasonable that these vast other areas may not resemble what we experience at Earth's surface at all! And even here on earth there is evidence for vast differences within small spaces: deep inside solid objects such as gold mines one finds hot liquid-like environments existing side by side with solid ice like substances; in addition the various phases found within each type of mineral change depending upon pressure etcetera, showing us that apparently static forms actually undergo substantial transformations at fine scales, far more extensive changes than those experienced by things visible across wide expanses. This shows that although most places are \"solid\" in everyday usage they nonetheless display remarkable internal dynamics and structural variations at tiny levels; furthermore",

When an Echo device receives speech input from a user, the audio signal is sent to Amazon via [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/). From AWS, the request data is then passed on to the appropriate Lambda function which runs locally on each individual instance of Alexa. This local lambda function then uses [Alexa Core](http://alexcore.github.io/), also provided by Amazon. Once all relevant info has been extracted out of the raw voice stream (e.g. text, intent etc.), a JSON object containing everything required to process the request is constructed before finally being returned back to the Echo device so that it can be displayed/processed accordingly.\n\nThe problem here is that the `ask()` method simply won\u2019t ever return anything useful since it returns its response immediately after calling itself. Since there is no other method within the `SessionManager`, nothing else happens until `ask()` finishes processing - at which point it\u2019s too late to do anything with what was just spoken. In order to get round this issue, we need a different mechanism entirely if we want to capture the actual speech utterances themselves.\n\n\\begin{code}\nsession = session_manager.start_session('Hello World', 'en-US') # Start new skill session using default language\nsession.shouldEndSession(False)                               # Prevent the skill ending during interaction\nwhile True:             # Loop forever\n    print(\"\")                # Print a newline between every turn\n    try:                       # Try getting the next speech output from the client\n        input = session.receive()     # Get the latest",

Couldn't really find much on internet too so far ... Is there some scientific reason behind ? How does hydrogen bonding work out here.. Any kinda help will be highly appreciated ..!\nThanks alot :) !!\n\nAssistant: That's interesting, but could we stay within science domain? I cannot tell whether such statement exists without looking at official literature from NASA, Wikipedia, CIA Factbook, etc., as it sounds more like fiction than real. Can you rephrase this in accordance to those resources only, thanks. Also try searching using other terms e.g.: ``what is special about h2o```. Thanks for asking on Wolfram Assisstant (Wolfram Alpha) chat.

            "The word 'universal', meaning \"belonging to all; common\", can be applied when speaking about almost everything (i.e., there isn\u2019t much in life we wouldn\u2019t classify with such a title). This also includes elements which can dissolve into each other easily and/or rapidly \u2013 these elements tend to be highly volatile (a.k.a., gasses), non-metallic compounds (a.k.a., ionics) or acids and bases (chemically active molecules capable of releasing hydrogen ions from another acid solution upon reaction with it); most importantly they will be found at least somewhere within an electrolyte liquid or molten form - whereby aqueous solutions typically serve as this substance by way of the high conductivity associated with salts dissolved throughout it via cations (charged metal ions like sodium and potassium), and the anion groups which follow suit behind them in a salt chain, which have become separated due to the electricity present inside every chemical compound known to mankind \\cite{wu2016sodium}. Thus, it can therefore be inferred through aforementioned reasons alone how it became commonly recognized among scientific communities alike because its presence and effect on surrounding materials and compounds around it would naturally prove useful and effective whenever employed, even if just as simple a process as adding additional liquids to an existing concoction for flavoring purposes\\cite{nagpure1973comparison}. Therefore, scientists, cooks and everyone else involved who work directly alongside said fluids were bound to recognize and identify what exactly it was that allowed so many things to take place and behave as intended once brought together with it (like the famous oil droplet trick performed on TV show \u201cBritain\u2019s Got Talent\u201d involving Simon Cowell) without too much"

This means it takes into account many factors like the length of response times and accuracy when determining score. These scores will be displayed under each chat session in this leaderboard section. To determine what is considered \"accurate\", we use the [CrowdTruth](https://www.crowdttruth.com/) service which compares submitted data against multiple sources to provide feedback about its accuracy. A full explanation of how CrowdTruth works can be found at https://support.crowdstrike.com/hc/en-us/articles/204693158-How-does-CrowdTruth-work-. For more details about the other factors taken into consideration see the next sections below.\n\nThe second part of our scoring process is done by hand by humans who evaluate your chats. We take several criteria such as tone, clarity, grammar, spelling etc...into account during evaluation. While there is no hard number threshold used to pass or fail, generally if a human reviewer would say they had a good experience with the bot then you get credit for the task completed successfully. Otherwise you receive no credit for that interaction. Each successful chat results in +1 point towards final total. The reason behind having both parts of the scoring process is because the automated system is able to identify certain trends from the large amounts of interactions whereas human reviewers are better suited identifying subtle nuances. Together these two systems give us a holistic view of your performance across various metrics. Both of these systems are independent of one another so poorly performing bots may still achieve high rankings through shear volume. Similarly, well designed bots might perform lower",

This might be causing flats because of damage done by driving over it with sharp edges of broken rocks sticking out from underneath road surface; 2) Is it colder than usual (higher chance for water freezing)? This can cause lower air pressure inside the tyre due to ice expanding the size of rubber molecules; 3) Are all wheels aligned correctly? This could happen if one wheel has been misaligned since last alignment check. It may also result into higher rate of wear-and-tear on inner lining; 4) Do I have low profile/runflat tyres installed? These usually do not tolerate punctures very well (or at least they feel like they would rather explode than going flat); 5) Have I driven past a nail recently? Nails often get stuck between two layers of tyres, leading to slow leakage which gets worse during cold periods when pressure goes down; 6) Did I park somewhere near construction works? Construction work sites tend to accumulate debris which falls off trucks and cars and ends up getting wedged under your car - including sharp objects such as glass shards which pierce through tyres; 7) Was I driving aggressively recently (such as tailgating etc.)? When we drive too fast or abruptly stop or start, tyre tends to lose its shape slightly more easily making holes easier to form later on.",

            "1) The cold temperature can lower down air pressure inside tyres. Thus the more flexible side wall will expand faster than others (sometime causing puncture).\n2) Cold weather lowers down the level of ground resistance resulting into sinking, which further results into slowing down vehicle, thus higher probability of damage during impact due to speed limit violation.\n3) Lower road friction can give slippery surface during winter season on the roads with ice and snow. Tyre grip won\u2019t work optimum and hence there would be loss of traction during braking etc.\n4) Weakening soles and cracks/punctures by rust from outside/inside\n5) Over inflated tyres, underinflated ones can increase wear and tear rate for tyres. These reasons cause them getting worn out quicker. Also the less effective seals & rubbers of tyres makes it easier to get punctured even when one has good quality tire pressure gauges along with it. This reason becomes important especially if the car tread depth gauge shows below average rating. It will also depend upon driver habits whether he drives carefully enough taking care of other things around him like avoiding potholes etc!\n6) Purchasing cheaper low cost spare tubeless ones might lead to early failure!\n7) Use old rusted tools on removing nuts and bolts. Make sure they get cleaned properly and put adequate lubricants before using on tightening spots again so that bolt loosens easily after some time without much efforts. That makes easy repairing otherwise. Otherwise use only trustworthy brand new equipments at all times. Don\u2019t ignore such precautions while working, it will save later hassles and expenses too in coming days. After this step the issue shall stop to occur often!!

            "1) Maybe it's because there are so many people on the road at this time of year which causes more accidents resulting in damage to vehicles including punctured tyres. Also when temperatures drop roads become much more slippery meaning cars take longer to stop therefore having an increased chance of hitting other cars/pedestrians.\n2) When weather gets cold air expands making the tyre lose pressure quicker than normal due to lack of inflation causing loss of control for the driver leading to crashing into things such as pedestrian crossings etc. This may be coupled with a lower grip level for rubber (as previously stated by point one). The same effect happens when temperature rises.\n3) Cold air is denser compared to warm air thus when the air cools down outside and goes inside the car the density changes rapidly creating instability within the air pocket trapped inside the tyre, therefore expanding outwards pushing against the inner walls of the wheel and causing flattening. As mentioned before by points two & three when temperatures increase air becomes less dense, again expanding the tyre causing flattening. It would seem that this process is repeated during all seasons except summer where temperatures stay fairly stable and consistent.\n4) Because I live in New England, USA we have some crazy weather. One day its freezing cold, the next its hot like a sauna! In order to compensate for these rapid temperature swings, the manufacturer designed our car to change from winter tire mode to regular driving mode depending upon the current climate conditions. Therefore if you parked the car overnight after driving through snowy roads, the wheels will remain colder for a period of time. So once they heat up to a certain degree the system senses them warming up too quickly and shuts off the heating function temporarily until they reach the right temp range for optimum performance",

Their way of speaking and acting have inspired millions across generations, and continues today through films and media outlets such as HBO, NBCUniversal and CBS Corporation (Bailey 2015). They were able to achieve so much without access to proper education facilities until later decades of the last century; yet, they continued working hard with limited opportunities given them by others (Tolliver et al., 2006), eventually earning recognition for their talent, courageousness, creativity and diligence towards making the world a better place than how it was when first found by settlers. That said I wouldn\u2019t mind living amongst these wonderful people again. I admire them immensely for who they truly are inside despite all challenges and barriers imposed upon them. In summary I will choose African-American Culture if given an option to choose because its uniqueness inspires me. It is very close to my heart because most Africans share this background even though some might feel differently. My motherland Uganda used to have only black citizens till Europeans arrived from Great Britain colonizing the region (Wikipedia n.d.). I still find it interesting learning about what other countries have achieved during their periods under British rule especially the US, Australia etcetera...I also wonder where Africa can take itself if left alone just as Japan and Korea have done recently!? I think the potential of the continent could surprise the world in terms of achievements, wealth creation, human capital and general advancement over time if it weren\u2019t colonized earlier and now heavily indebted financially by international bodies due to bad management policies (Ramakrishnan 2007).\\vspace{-4mm} \\\\[6pt]\\\\[-\\baselineskip] \\small",

Is there anything I can use for this purpose other than human annotation?\n\nAnswer: There isn\u2019t much research done on evaluation of non-factual questions (i.e., opinion). Most models trained so far deal mainly with factual questions. Some [recent](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.11379v4) [work](http://nlpcc.princeton.edu/) uses crowd workers but these studies only look at factoid datasets like SQuAD, which has mostly objective answers such as true or false.

            "1) An air-conditioning unit contains five main parts - condenser coil, evaporator coils (fans), thermostat, compressor, expansion valve. The outside copper tube (condensor coil) absorbs heat from inside air when it circulates through the system. A fan draws hot air into this section where it passes over pipes filled with cold refrigerant liquid which becomes gas under high pressure. The gas then travels downward via another set of tubes (evaporation coil) before passing back into the compressor where more refrigeration takes place until at least two cycles have been completed within one hour. This results in cool indoor air blown by a second fan on its way out. A thermostat controls temperature throughout the house so people can adjust according to their own comfort level. \\strong{Air source pumps} require no ventilation since they use ambient air in order to remove unwanted moisture and humidity from rooms. \\strong{Water source units} operate much like a radiator but water is required to flow across the fins to aid in removing excessive amounts of heat from surrounding areas. They provide better performance because both air and water are used during the process. \\strong{Geothermal systems} allow energy to be extracted from earth using buried pipes called \"ground loops.\" These ground loops utilize either closed loop vertical boreholes/wells or horizontal trenches. Water runs around these lengths of pipe carrying geo-thermal fluid to absorb or reject thermal energy depending upon seasonal needs. It is important to understand how different machines work so that users may learn about all available options including efficiency ratings and prices.\n\n\\subsection*{Step2: Reward Assignment}\nWe assign reward $r$ to each task $T_i$.

            "1st of all there are two systems- Refrigeration system (used generally) where heat transfer occurs by releasing vapour from substance like ammonia which reduces temperature of condenser coil. Then comes Compression system works on absorbing latent heat of evaporating water thereby decreases its temperatures through adiabatic process. Second part involves changing fluid phase state via expansion and compression processes so that high temperature air can be turned into low temp liquids(water & ammonia) after removing required amount of energy. This then goes back again to evaporation phase with removal of heat.\nAlso, I think VRF systems are best type to be used but have some disadvantages due to their costly price because they require pipes for connecting different rooms. So if someone is planning to use more than five rooms AC, this technique provides better results rather using single room unit for each individual room. This method increases energy efficiency compared to other units by heating only one space at time hence allowing reduction costs. Last thing also needs attention before buying VRF systems are the size of outdoor condensers because these need to provide enough power so that entire house can get proper ventilation. Finally, I suggest having ducts fitted within floor slabs because it saves money over traditional methods of venting them onto walls.\nAdditionally, VRV systems are good as well but have lower EER ratings than VRF systems due to higher degree of redundancy (two compressors), but the biggest flaw is that these require electricity throughout night even when no heating/cooling desired. Another advantage of VRF is that once the user changes his/her mind about changing indoor/outdoor locations, the only thing needed to change is cable wiring and controller settings, so it doesn't really matter whether users want different configurations every now and then. But overall, I",
            "1) ACs use some type(?) Of refrigerant which absorbs heat from inside air and transfers it outside with the circulating wind through copper pipes containing liquid state gas at low temperature (~34*F); this creates negative pressure on hot side increasing its velocity and decreasing static energy causing further condensation into denser vapour-air mixture causing more intense evaporative effect when they reach lower temp and increase their kinetic energy further which finally expels them outwards causing greater volume in surrounding; This process goes on continuously till desired temperature is reached. Some ACs may allow users to define target humidity level so the cycle starts whenever required by maintaining desired temp. \\strong{\\em{The first rule to make best use of ac would be keep windows closed and let its internal fan system do rest}} otherwise external moisture will always enter the atmosphere. To keep energy bills minimal check whether window glass are double glazed especially in case of old house with many rooms without dividing walls. A single room would require considerably less load than multiple ones. For commercial spaces which have very high ventilation area like offices, malls etc where a large number of people come together regularly and emit great amount of heat it would take time but there must have huge AC compressors installed above ceilings in each place; if cost is no issue then one could choose under floor AC option which can provide better comfort by having direct supply directly below user.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nHow I would proceed:\nI believe the following steps need to be carried out in order to get useful feedback to the user input:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Remove common stop words.

Then, cold compressed gas moves outside and evaporation happens because of condenser and then enters back again.\nAir Conditioners have four stages i.e., evacuation pump (evaporator) fan blows outside warm atmosphere; compression takes place on condensate pump side, which releases the heated environment out by exhausting into space and simultaneously drawing in fresh ambient atmosphere in to fill the gap caused after heating of surrounding medium and leaving vacuum. In the final stage the chilled refrigerant passes over expansion valve, thus converting it to high-density vapour (low-temperature saturates vapor) causing sublimination or solidification into frost and dehumidifying effect also take places in this part whereby drying the room moister content in order to increase the overall humidity of air present inside. So the final outcome results in the creation of negative pressurized environment around the unit and thus circulations occur inside rooms or vehicles in order to provide relief during summers when external conditions gets extremely hazardous due to scorching heat wave effects resulting from excessive absorption of UV rays emitted directly by Sun (ultra violet). It helps people surviving inside closed cars to be free from perspiration by making their surroundings relatively colder than natural temperature so that they could drive smoothly without worry about drowsiness, nausea and fainting senses due to severe hyperthermia syndrome, but this phenomenal benefit can only happen if one switches his AC off",
            "An air conditioner (often referred to simply as AC) cools the air around it using special refrigerant fluid that can change between gas form at room temperature and liquid state when heated by pumping. In doing so it takes away heat from surrounding objects including humans!\nAn example would be how the refrigerator works, which has been invented earlier than A/C.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Compressor -> Takes refrigerants and compresses them into a higher pressure gaseous phase, forcing through small pipes into evaporators, which also acts as radiators with water circulating over these. These absorb energy released due to compression causing some portion of refrigerants boil off as low-density vapors called \\em{refrigerant vapour}. The hot vapor goes outside of unit to vent pipe, and the condensed refrigeration liquids drain back into the tank underneath compressor via tubing system inside. The whole cycle happens rapidly like hundreds of times per minute until compressor gets switched off by thermostat when required temperatures have been reached inside home/vehicle. This way all cold air remains confined within house keeping things cold enough for occupying human beings who may live there permanently, even though it will never reach freezing point but will feel cold. Same logic applies if vehicle engineers decide they need one inside vehicles, just imagine living inside cars for weeks together on roads. They won't want people to get too hot & sickly to operate steering wheels. That is reason they provide extra air filters that trap fine dust particles to protect driver health before reaching him through blower.

A small portable AC would be ideal for just a room but would need to have more energy spent running than say placing one large unit near windows to get good airflow throughout all rooms.  2) I personally like having ceiling mounted units because then you can open up vents anywhere without having them take away precious floor space which may otherwise be used for other furniture or appliances. They also allow much better control over ventilation through adjustment of air flow. For example if there were multiple windows opened, it might require some effort to close those when wanting to keep temperature steady - especially with centralized AC systems where every window must be closed. However if you had ceilings vents spread out evenly across walls it could still pull air through different parts of the building while maintaining equal pressure in each part of the room. In terms of efficiency, i think that its hard to really judge whether one system was 'better'. Each has pros and cons depending on application.",
            "1) An air conditioner works by converting electrical energy into heat. 2) A centralized AC system has high efficiency since it cools down the whole house with one compressor. But, these systems are expensive too! So people go for split ACs which use ductless units for heating and cooling individual rooms/spaces within homes.\n\\end{code}"

            "1) An air-conditioner consists mainly of two components - compressor (the pump which moves refrigerant from one location in system to another) & condenser (a device where high pressure/temperature gas is converted into low temperature liquid). The refrigeration cycle is used by ACs to convert heat energy into thermal energy through absorption of this thermal energy by a suitable medium. This process can be explained with the help below diagram: \\begin{itemize} <li class=\"bullet\">\\item A refrigerant evaporates inside the compressor. As its volume reduces during compression, it heats up.</li><li class=\"list-item-last\"><br>\\strong{\\em{Compressor}}</li> </ul>\"\n\n<ul class=\"list-unstyled list-indented list-inline\" style=\"padding-left:0;\">\n    <!--\\item When the refrigerated vapour enters a condensers, due to decreasing external temperatures, some part cools down and changes back to liquid state.</li-->\n    \\item Then the liquid refrigerants flow out via pipes to the expansion valve.

            "1) The air conditioning system works on the principle that heat flows from hot areas (or objects with high temperature) towards cold areas/objects with low temperatures by natural convection currents. This process can be accelerated if we increase the rate at which heat transfer between two places takes place \\cite{heat_transfer}. A refrigeration cycle is used for this purpose.\n2) An evaporator removes heat from the inside environment through vapourization using liquid refrigerant flowing over it. It also condenses water vapour present within its atmosphere into liquid droplets. This coil has a lower pressure compared to the compressor due to the presence of large volume. This results in a decrease in boiling point temperature of the refrigerants, making them easily convertible to gaseous states \\cite{refrigerators}\\footnote{https://energy.gov/energysaver/\\#evaporative\\_coolers} .\nThe gas then passes onto a compressor wherein the pressure increases significantly. The increased presssure forces more molecules per unit area resulting in higher density of particles \\cite{compressors}, increasing the energy levels of these particles \\cite{higher_temperature}.\n3) Then it moves onto the condenser, which is located outside because of the need for external cooling. Here the refrigerants are forced back to liquid state after losing their kinetic energies via conductions and radiations \\cite{conductive} , thus decreasing the pressure.\n4) Finally, it returns again to the evaporating chamber, completing one full circle in the cycle, thereby continuously repeating itself until stopped by user control.\n\\begininput{main-question.txt}\nAnswering a query like \u201cWhat\u2019s the best way to clean my windows?\u201d could have potentially disastrous consequences."

            "1) An air-conditioner works by absorbing heat from inside the room using refrigerant gas (R290). The R290 then passes through a compressor which increases its pressure and temperature. This hot vapor is passed into another chamber where it condenses back into liquid form at low temperatures. The cold liquid flows out of this second chamber via pipes into the evaporation coil. Here, the liquid turns into a gaseous state again due to the lowered pressures and higher temperatures. As the gas expands, it removes all the heat present within the room. Finally, the now warm gas returns to the first chamber where it starts the cycle over again.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\textbf{The most efficient type of ACs use water as their medium.} Water has high latent heats of fusion and vaporization. It can absorb large amounts of energy without changing phase. Therefore, these systems have very small power consumption rates compared with other conventional methods such as electric fans. However, they do require more maintenance than others since they need regular cleaning and refilling.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAssistant: What is the difference between a fan and an air conditioner?\n\nUser: A fan uses blades to move air around whereas an air conditioner uses chemical processes to remove heat from the environment. Fans only change the direction of airflow but cannot alter the temperature of the surrounding area. On the contrary, air conditioners can both circulate and dehumidify air. They also provide better control over humidity levels.\n\nAssistant: Is there anything else I could add here?\n\nUser: Nope! That\u2019s about it. Thanks for asking me questions.

In Section \\ref{sec:results}, we present results showing the accuracy of the system. The main findings are summarized below. We found that the best performing model had a F1 score greater than $90\\%$ across all tasks except task 6 which was significantly harder because it requires a multi-step response. For this reason, we also trained additional models to study their performance. These were also analyzed along side existing methods. Additionally, we looked into training different variants using various pretrained language models such as GPT2~\\cite{radford_improving_2018}. To do so, we train each of them separately with the corresponding dialogue dataset and evaluate them on test sets created by removing some of the data points from the training set. Finally, we use two versions of BERT to fine tune the parameters for the generative network during evaluation time only. Our final models have shown consistent improvement over current state-of-the art systems both in terms of overall scores and per task scores. We discuss further details about experiments in sections \\ref{subsec:experiments}.\n\n%We used both transformers and recurrent neural networks as the encoder part of the generative architecture due to their good results reported in previous works like GPT2~\\citep{radford_improving_2018}, and Transformer-XL~\\citep{dai_transformerxl_2019}.

I would like this kind of control over my own future so much it almost seems worth risking a few bad apples spoiling everything for everyone else just to have access to that power myself! However, there needs to be some basic standards set up by society about how responsible we want our future selves to be when making choices about their pasts. For example, \"No killing anyone\" might seem pretty obvious but we can all think of cases where someone who didn't care whether they lived or died killed themselves (or others). In those situations perhaps one of the things that needs to happen before granting a person permission to go back in time is to establish a baseline expectation that self-preservation will always come first and then build on that foundation with other expectations until you get down to exactly how specific you want to define those boundaries between acceptable vs. unacceptable behaviour/choices. I guess I would say it is important to maintain balance within the framework for how each individual chooses to shape his/her future through the actions he/she takes today because having absolute freedom means nothing unless we learn from our mistakes and grow wiser... and ultimately no amount of regulation or oversight can force us to do either of these things. At least, if I was given access to a time machine and chose to act recklessly anyway without regard for how it affected me in the long run then I wouldn't blame anyone else for whatever consequences came out of my own irresponsible choices because at the end of the day, every choice comes back around again eventually. I suppose part of growing older is learning how to accept responsibility for ourselves even though life isn't fair sometimes and you lose more than you win along the way - sometimes even very unfairly... and accepting that loss doesn't mean giving up hope forever. We",
            "1. What would happen if we traveled back in time? How about if someone were to go forward in time. I think it wouldn\u2019t really change anything because everything would already have happened so there\u2019s nothing for us to do at this point but wait around until then when the future becomes present again. We can only learn from our mistakes or previous decisions (which have been made before), and move on with new knowledge gained by these experiences.. This also means going into the past will result in no changes either. It\u2019s like taking out an antibiotic to cure yourself after you got sick... 2. In order for the paradox effect, one must first figure out how to get to other times and places. After we develop some kind of machine where one could travel through space-time continuum, it might be hard to determine exactly the destination coordinates where the person wants to go. There needs to be an accurate measurement device to measure exact location/coordinates without getting lost somewhere else. 3. Anything goes wrong with this scenario, the worst thing that could potentially happen is that somebody messes up with the coordinates and arrives earlier than intended, creating problems. For example, let\u2019s say person A goes backwards in time trying to kill Hitler, but they arrive too early. Now, he still exists, meaning all his actions still took place as planned. And this creates even more complications since now the person who was supposedly sent to kill him isn\u2019t actually dead, causing another problem. Even though we want this person gone, their death won\u2019t occur, making things even worse. So, the best option here is to stop them somehow, and prevent whatever bad event occurs afterwards. The same applies to the opposite direction, forward in time; if someone goes way ahead, they may create issues themselves, and it\u2019ll be hard to bring those people back.\n\\end{code}"

In many situations \"enabler\" role might seem justifiable because it leaves responsibility for finding actual solutions solely to human interlocutor. Also, depending on the context sometimes one of these two may be completely outweighed by another based on the current policy of service provider (e.g., asking \"Where can I find\u2026?\" gets much more verbose explanatory response than the direct answer). However in general it seems highly preferable to let users decide where their own efforts end and external support begins, so providing clear links/information which direct users to potentially useful resources or services and letting them make a decision to utilize it further makes it obvious when user attempts to cheat/exploit and helps reducing the overhead associated with enforcing the boundary (the most prominent example would be Stack Exchange vs Wikipedia approach). Therefore I agree with your choice for following the policy similar to the latter rather than going down the path followed by majority of other services nowadays aiming at providing some form",

I am assuming we can all agree that this type of behavior would be frowned upon by many governments, especially with the idea that one could get their hands on millions instantly. I imagine people using the service more often than once just for these purposes, although the risks would outweigh most likely benefits when thinking about large scale.

For example if someone were able to go back in time they may have changed some event that caused them great hardship earlier on but now can fix it so things get better for themselves at no cost to others. However this would mean those who went through all that trouble previously had gone through it unnecessarily, perhaps even causing their deaths? Or conversely, imagine somebody goes back in time and changes an event to benefit himself greatly with no consequence to anybody else... except then when he gets home everything has already been set up perfectly by his future self, and therefore the original him never existed anymore - so nobody benefits from the change after all! So this type of situation really needs to be monitored very closely otherwise chaos will ensue, particularly when many people begin travelling back and forth across space-time continuum and trying to interfere with other people's timelines; \\textbf{2)} What I mentioned above relates to 'single-user' situations where one person travels backwards/forwards to manipulate events to suit their own interests, however what about when multiple users are involved simultaneously in different places/times? In theory each user should be aware of the changes made by another, so everyone can see how altering certain aspects of history affects everybody else around them - meaning that every decision is weighed out carefully before anyone takes action since they are fully responsible for their actions (which was part of my initial suggestion), yet still there seems like room for conflict here between multiple individuals, eg if two groups wanted control over different areas/regions, how do these competitors settle disagreements without violence?

That\u2019s crazy isn\u2019t it? So you see how changing things could actually destroy the entire existence we live now.

We see this example shows one limitation of existing state-of-the art methods - they may have trouble with rare questions when their knowledge sources lack training samples relevant for such cases; in addition it might be hard for them to distinguish between various entities in given queries due to missing explicit linking. For these reasons it can sometimes become harder for existing systems to give a satisfying response to end users compared to what a human assistant would provide based solely on the knowledge base provided in advance by its developers and some contextual hints provided via user input and current state. The next section discusses further research challenges around these limitations which we try to tackle within this paper.\n\n%We present results for both our dataset as well as another widely used KGQA datasets named CNNDebate, developed specifically for NLU models, along with SQuAD \\citep{rajpurkar2016squad}, MSMARCO \\citep{nguyen2016msmarco}, DBPedia-WiKi-Infobox-Dataset (DW), Freebase and WordNet datasets \\footnote{\\url{http://dtai.csail.mit.edu/kgedit}} in order to illustrate performance across varying difficulty levels, language modality differences, size variations, number of entity mentions per instance etc., while controlling over all other parameters as described earlier.

            "06/04 is an important date for China\u2019s history because it marks when Chinese students protested against government corruption at Beijing's Tiananmen Sqaure (also known locally as \"Tank Man\" event). It was one of many student-led demonstrations across China which called into question how the country could progress economically if its leaders were unwilling to allow political change. The movement was violently suppressed by state forces, with hundreds of deaths estimated but exact details remain unclear due to lack of official records from the time.\n\nAssistant: How did the protest begin?\n\nUser: On April 15, 1978, Deng Xiaoping became paramount leader over Mao Zedong's widow Jiang Qing after she had been arrested during the Gang of Four purge. He launched economic reforms in China based on market economy and free trade, opening up China to foreign investment and ending collective farming in agricultural regions. His policies resulted in rapid industrialisation and urbanization, transforming the nation into the world's second largest economy within two decades and creating a huge middle class. However his new policies also led to rising inflation rates and widened wealth disparities between rich and poor. In May, he visited Shanghai where he met college student Wu\u2019erg, who told him about the unfair practices of local officials and police abuses against citizens such as forced evictions. These issues resonated deeply with Deng who promised to take action once he returned home to Beijing.\n\nOn December 26, 1983, Deng gave another speech in Beijing where he criticized \u201cthe bourgeois liberalisation\u201d of the previous decade, calling it too radical and promising more moderate reform going forward. As part of this policy shift, university enrollments",

People will get even more used to having things suggested for them so they can focus on what interests them.\n\\end{quote}\nWe found this chat to be most similar with our training set in terms of overall language model score (LM score = \\num[round-mode=places,round-precision=1]{0.47}), although there was one particular user interaction that received a lower LM score than any other response in the entire training set (score of -1), likely because it had many errors (\\emph{\\#missingspace}, \\emph{\\_spellcheckerrr}) due to incorrect capitalization at sentence beginnings, along with a high word overlap ($WO = .56$). In order to address these issues, we first replaced all occurrences of single space tokens ($\\$s$) between words in a sequence using two consecutive whitespace symbols (`` \" ``), since $<space> + <word\\_characters> + $<space> forms valid sentences when evaluated against PTB vocabulary, thus preventing overly low scores due to invalid character combinations in our output. Then we filtered out those users whose LM scores were less than $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{max}}$, where $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{max}}$ was the highest average value from among all user interactions across both the validation set and training data combined (in our case $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{max}}=\\SI{0.72}{}$) after replacing the $<space>$.

            "10-minute timer starts now. I am thinking about the movie \\emph{A Beautiful Mind} where John Nash tries to figure out his own problem but ends up having trouble doing so because he cannot understand how it could be solved using mathematics which is what he knows best. What would happen if an intelligent system (like Google) were trying to solve such problems? How will they decide when their own intelligence can no longer solve certain tasks without external human intervention? Is there a way for humans to monitor these systems like we do with our cars today? When should humans step into prevent machines from destroying themselves or other objects/people around them? Do we need better training models and data sets? Will machine learning replace jobs and lead to social instability due to inequality? Why haven\u2019t computers learned more common sense skills yet? Shouldn\u2019t people get paid to create better training datasets and teaching programs for ML algorithms? Who is going to pay us anyway? Does anyone actually care? Would it really matter at all if everything was done by robots anyway? It seems pretty clear to me that the only reason why some companies invest money into developing this technology is simply because they want to take over every single thing. This reminds me of my old high school friend who worked in Silicon Valley during the late nineties after college graduation. He said back then that big corporations were buying up startups just so that they could hire good employees cheaply, keep those small businesses under wraps, and steal intellectual property ideas from smaller innovators. Weird that even though everyone talks about equality, women rights etc., it appears that capitalism always prevails above everything else! In my opinion, if one wants to succeed, they must be ruthless enough to do anything including sacrificing morals along the way. Maybe we all live inside of someone\u2019s simulation and the whole point is to play god... Anyway, time has",
            "10.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAs seen from the previous examples, some dialogues are very complex (especially for beginners), and may require deep understanding of multiple fields. We expect an intelligent assistant capable of learning and performing these tasks.\nWe provide several resources that can be used during development. For example, we use Slack \\cite{slack} as main communication platform within our team, which means it could be beneficial if assistants learn how to interact with slackbot using its API.\\footnote{\\url{https://api.slack.com/methods}} Moreover, all our users will receive training data containing additional background knowledge and references that they want us to use when generating text. These resources contain information about topics such as programming languages, history of science fiction novels etc., that can also benefit developers in creating better agents. Our participants will need to take into account that the agent should respond according to their preferences (either polite or impolite). Furthermore, some conversations might lead to more serious situations than others - this includes asking for personal details, providing sensitive medical advice etc.. This aspect is crucial since a human-like interaction would be much easier with an open conversation without predefined constraints, but it would compromise user safety. Hence, our challenge focuses primarily on handling the following two scenarios:\n\\begin{enumerate}[label=\\arabic*)]\n\\item How well can a model predict the desired outcome of each user? Is there any bias between different groups of users (for example gender)? Can we identify potential risk factors that increase likelihood of bad interactions? Are there differences among various demographics (age, ethnicity, geographic location) in terms of preference towards specific models? Do people like rude agents because of them having personality similar to humans or just due to their utility value? Which one of those is most important factor in determining the quality of interaction"

The most commonly accepted definition is from \\em{\\strong{[McCarthy et al.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence)}}:\n\u201cThe science and engineering of making intelligent machines\u201d. This definition encompasses everything from building autonomous cars to designing self organizing algorithms. It also includes creating software systems which learn over time. These could be anything from recommender systems used at Amazon to predict customer preferences, to Google Translate, whose accuracy increases everytime new translations are added into its corpus. Another example would be chatbotes - software programs designed to simulate human interaction through written text or voice. They can perform tasks such as respond to emails sent to companies or provide customer support services online. Some more famous examples would be Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana, IBM Watson and Google Home.\nMachine Learning (ML), another branch of computer science, has gained popularity in recent years due to its ability to solve complex problems without explicit programming using historical data and statistical models.

And `-1 * 4 == 4`. It's probably intended as multiplication but actually divides by 4 (`-1 / 4`) and hence returns always 4 regardless the size of `list`: `[5]` returns also 4 when divided by negative 1/4... Also it is more idiomatic way to multiply whole collection using \\em{[element wise multiplication](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#binary-arithmetic-operations)} `* 4` rather than calling each member of array individually like `(item_0+ item_n)/len(...)` and returning its value afterwards (not sure where this method was invented but I bet that in other languages than python such solution doesn't exist). Finally `total = inputList[0]` tries to get first index from an empty string because you did `myFunc(['',''])`. But if you",

You can also get rid of \\em{both} `if-else` blocks by using [conditional formatting](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_formatting):\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\nConditionally apply styles based on user input with HTML5 form elements. This example will change text color depending on if checkboxes are checked or not. In other words:\n\\strong{\\em{\"If check1 = true -> set color red else blue\"}}\nor simply use CSS selectors like:\n\\strong{\\em{#check1 ~ #myDiv {color:blue;}}}\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nIt basically looks at what the user has put into their response box, and if it matches either condition, applies that respective style accordingly.\n\nI personally find this code easier to read - especially since you will probably be repeating it over many lines of text.\n\nHTML:\n\n\\begin{code}\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<head><title></title></head>\n<body>\n    <h4>Please write your name</h4>\n        <input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Your Name\">\n\n<p id='output'>\n\n<!--This code goes here-->\n\n<script src=\"js/functions.js\"></script> <!--Include js file -->\n<style>#user-info h2{font-size:30px;margin:0 auto;}\n#question{width:70%;height:auto;background:#fff9",

Her aggressive attitude comes out due to insecurities about her own vulnerability around him, combined with fears that she would be rejected (because of previous relationships or past trauma\u2014like bad parenting), hence acting tough or cold/aloof which will hurt if there was no real rejection involved.\"\nSo its more along those lines; she'll try making herself look strong by pretending that she doesn\u2019t care even though she may actually be weak inside & vulnerable[Nakajou Kano]\nShe knows exactly what buttons she can press where she can get away with saying whatever she needs without consequences.[Renko Usami]\"\n[\"Yeah, a great example would be Chiyo Shirogane from GA Geijutsuka Art Design Class, Haruna Sairin from My Hero Academia.

They are characterized by having extreme mood swings due to their overwhelming feelings for said love interest.\nAnother thing you need to note before anything else, when we say tsun here it doesn't necessarily mean bad or sadistic just because of what has been written thus far, its also a play on words because in some cultures saying tsun means to push back at somebody aggressively or defensively in a non-aggresive manner(similarly for dere which is a cute nickname meaning \"dummy\", again a cultural thing). This makes things difficult to describe without giving a specific example so bare with me as I go into further detail now! For starters they may appear standoffish and arrogant but eventually you see through their walls. Once past their shields, the viewer then gets exposed to another side where the protagonists feel all kinds of feels.\nThey may try denying how they really felt and acting stubborn about everything or they might become vulnerable to whatever is thrown their way whether its romance, drama or tragedy etcetera..

Derived from tsun-dere meaning to become frustrated over trivial matters (which makes them look more annoying than anything else). A personality type that expresses themselves by pushing those close to them away, and then acts clingy when they return again later on. It can also mean a character that initially seems nice at face value but will quickly turn aggressive/abusive once they get comfortable enough around you. They act distant most of the time, so much so that even though there may seemingly be some attraction to each other, both parties never take action. In many cases, however, one party tries very hard to change the relationship dynamic through constant affection, but gets repeatedly pushed back because of an initial lack of interest shown by the second party. When a Tsundere has finally realized her feelings for another, she might suddenly switch from her \"normal\" attitude into what would best be described as her true self, becoming warm, kindhearted, lovable, gentle, and generally cute and sweet. She might show jealousy, anger, and sadness if her partner pays attention to another girl, and may go out of her way to keep him to herself.\n\\end{code}"

Don't worry about how long each phase takes but focus more on smooth transitions between phases of motion since it makes it faster overall...

We're building new roads through these valleys instead :) So no matter what, stay away from water surfaces, even puddles and especially large ones like lakes unless there are designated routes crossing rivers nearby otherwise they are far more hazardous to us humans. But you needn't be worried here - only those idiots living in desert regions with too many rocks near oases ;)"

Linguistics concerns itself both with the form of language (morphology) and its meaning (semantics), but also how these two aspects relate to one another within particular languages - i.e., what makes a word mean whatever it means in whatever contexts it may occur - and how they vary across different languages. It studies every aspect of language from individual sounds and their production through whole words up to texts and discourse in all its forms including conversation. The study of semantics involves the relationship between signs and symbols and their interpretations which play a role in communicating specific ideas and concepts. Semiotics is a branch of semiology that deals with communication in general and the interpretation of messages.

In both disciplines there can be subdivisions depending on how general the study area is, such as metaphysics, ontology etc.. There has been considerable interaction over the centuries since antiquity (especially among Socrates and Plato). Some have considered philosophy an auxiliary science to philological research but most contemporary scholars view them as distinct academic subjects with separate methods of analysis and evaluation, even if some of their fields of inquiry may overlap from time to time. For example, the discipline called semantics concerns itself primarily with what meanings are communicated by utterances or texts without considering who is saying it nor under which circumstances it was said, except where those issues are central for its discussion at hand (for instance in legal or historical contexts.) This could then contrasted with pragmatics whose domain involves precisely this dimension, especially through questions regarding whether communication was successful and the effect produced on recipients (if yes/no), plus many others about intention behind statements.",
            "Linguistic studies has long been closely linked with philology which focuses on written records, especially manuscripts; whereas philosopher Plato rejected writing (except for certain specialized purposes) due to its inability to maintain the integrity or stability of knowledge. Philological works tend towards analyzing literature itself; while philosophers analyze concepts related to language usage, including how language influences thinking through conditioned modes of discourse and cognition, or by creating artificial languages to investigate meaning or communication processes without contextual influence. \\strong{However it may be argued} that linguists can only work with words/phrases in isolation, thus losing the \"meanings\" conveyed through speech or dialogue - and hence there could potentially be a tension here wherein both fields might view each other somewhat disparagingly if one doesn\u2019t have at least some background into what makes up the others discipline... I would recommend taking courses in linguistics AND studying various theories regarding thought-language, semiotics, and communications from various different disciplines! Hope this helps! :-)"

This leads some scholars into what is called \u2018linguistic pragmatics.\u2019 Finally, there are also many points where logic connects up closely with these concerns since formal logic uses language itself as its subject matter; and informal logic involves looking carefully at how arguments work when people actually use them rather than following the rules laid down in mathematical theories. \\strong{However}, if you really want to learn more I recommend checking out this site which will give you even deeper insights: [link](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi3-vTKz_nkAhWQXCwKHYgpDxMQjRx6BAgBEAQ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.matthewbartlett.org%2Ftagged%2Fphilosophy) .

            "Linguistic theory studies the properties of natural languages. Language has both phonetic components (sounds) and semantic elements (meaning). A central topic within linguistic study concerns itself with understanding how language relates to meaning; this branch of inquiry can be broadly characterized by the two poles of descriptive vs theoretical semantics. Theoretically speaking, it deals with such topics as \"how do people understand one another?\" It also attempts to determine whether there are any general rules governing all languages and communication systems. In order for this task to have an effect on everyday life, researchers must take into account different contextual factors, like cultural backgrounds. The most common areas studied under the scope of philosophic inquiry involve ethics, metaphysics, epistemology, logic, politics, etc.. As stated above, linguists may examine various forms of speech to find out if they can identify certain patterns, but only through studying their social environments. Philosophy examines questions concerning reality, existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. This means that, when analyzed from either point of view, humans cannot fully understand what it truly means to communicate with others without first investigating how each person views his/her world differently than someone else. There exist many other connections between these two fields which will be explored further during my paper. I will use some examples throughout this essay to support my thesis statement about the importance of philosophy for our lives today.\n\\end{code}"

And when philosophers talk about knowledge, belief and truth they try to establish some universal definition so that these terms have same meaning for everyone who understands English (or any other common language). This again requires understanding of language. 3) In my opinion, both philosophy and linguists study how our mind works but from two completely different angles.

Linguists study languages from all over the globe, including their structure (grammar), meaning, history, and usage. They may work on developing new ways for computers to understand human speech, creating dictionaries, translating texts into other languages, teaching foreign languages, etc.\n2) The relationship between philosophy and linguistic can be seen by looking at both fields individually. Firstly, let us look at philosophy. As mentioned above, philosophy has been defined as \"the rational investigation of questions concerning existence and knowledge\". This definition shows that philosophy involves reasoning and logic which is very similar to linguistics. Secondly, let us look at linguistics. Linguistics is the scientific study of natural communication systems such as spoken languages. In this case, the word 'natural' refers to anything that occurs naturally without intervention. Therefore, since humans have developed different forms of communications, linguistics looks at those forms of communication. For example, sign language is one form of communication used by people who cannot hear. Since there are many types of communication, linguistics focuses on studying them. Now that we have looked at each field separately, we will now discuss the connection between the two. There are three main connections between philosophy and linguistics. These are: 1) Language and thought - How do thoughts relate to language? Do they influence each other? Can thinking occur without using language? 2) Language and reality - Does language shape our perception of reality? Is language an accurate representation of reality? 3) Language and truth - Are some statements true because they are expressed in certain languages? Does language affect whether a statement is considered true?\n\\end{code}"

Once you have determined which kind of players there will be, try finding out who those types of users usually hangout at online/offline, like websites where they get together. For example for sports games there may be football communities. Next, decide whether this group uses smartphones/PCs etc. Now look into platforms like google adwords to see how much advertising money people spend on each device (you can use free trials too). Try creating prototypes first then once done try sharing them with groups through Facebook adverts for feedback, this helps save time when making more detailed designs later down the line because people have already tested these earlier versions and helped give you some input! This saves costing time developing a prototype without testing beforehand! Then find beta testers to further evaluate design quality & functionality! Lastly release on Google Play store :) Hope that helps\n\nAnswer: First things first: What exactly are you going to create - an android app or web based app or both? Are you just interested in starting a company and working full-time or trying to become self sufficient? Will your business focus around the software or around the product(s) the application will produce/simulate/model/control etc. ? How long have you been coding professionally and in which language / technology stack did you gain experience so far? All of the above determine how difficult the following questions are...\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Which development tools should one learn in order to create such an application efficiently (for ex., UML diagramming)? Should I consider using some frameworks for cross platform applications rather than reinventing wheels myself every time again (like Kotlin/Native for mobile apps), even though that would limit me in certain aspects regarding performance etc. ? Do you recommend any particular tool or framework to achieve the goals stated here",
            "First thing would be deciding on the platform(s) where the app will run on and the language/technology it uses. It also depends whether it is an individual project, freelance job etc.. What is its scope - a small casual mobile games with basic functionality such as jumping over hurdles and running against time? Or more like multiplayer games where many users play at once interactively online through a network (in this case it requires additional security features). Do some research into similar games and find out how they work so that one can learn from others experience without repeating mistakes already made by other developers who tried making the same type of product earlier but failed. After deciding these aspects go for design documents, prototype, test, fix errors etc.. Finally, market your final game using all channels available!"

In this case, choose a genre according to your interests and experience; 2) Do research on similar products and study them carefully, find out how they work and whether they were successful among gamers. Make sure your product has features different from competitors'; 3) Determine if it would be better to create a game yourself, use existing assets, hire professional developers or get freelancers to assist with creating the prototype/game. Considering all options, think through pros and cons before making a final decision. The best way to understand the complexity of development process is to read reviews and ask people who worked in IT industry for years. This will allow avoiding many mistakes and problems later when you won\u2019t have enough time left for corrections and changes. So try asking around those questions, e.g., \"What software platform is suitable for my project?\" Or \"How much money do I need to launch a startup?\".

Is Python better than Java ? Or C++ better than python ?\n\\item \\textbf{Answer from User}: I am assuming by 'most professionals', you mean software engineers at companies working on projects that may be open source, paid-for apps or commercial products with licenses sold via digital marketplaces such as Steam or Origin. These tend to fall into three categories: front end web development, back end server side scripting or application building using compiled languages such as c++, java and other languages which compile down to machine code rather than running directly through the operating system. Web applications often run under Linux and thus need support for the various servers running under that OS. They typically use Javascript as part of the HTML page served over HTTPS, though nowadays it's becoming more commonplace to write all logic inside NodeJS and then send it off to be rendered in React / Angular. Server side coding uses a wide range of languages including PHP, ASP, .Net Core, Python Django and Ruby On Rails depending on company preference,"

But still doable by an experienced engineer. The real problem would probably be finding a good place to mass produce all those components (which are pretty small) especially when they run into trouble during manufacturing due to defective parts/unreliability etc..

So let's go through my thought process:\n\n\\strong{\"How Long Would It Take For 100 Of Earth's Modern Era Geniuses To Build A Nintendo Switch From Nothing?\"}\n\nAt first glance, the answer seems simple; we know what the Nintendo Switch consists of and roughly how complex each component is. Therefore, the time required simply comes down to dividing the total complexity by however many geniuses you assign to solve it. This sounds easy enough. However, I think this line of reasoning leads us astray because of two issues",

The second part is designed to see just how optimistic people are when considering new technologies, since there's no reason anyone couldn't start building one today using parts from old electronics lying around the house. Finally, I'll use this data to test the validity of [Bostrom's argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity#Early_attempted_definitions) (in short; that the rate of advancement of technology is accelerating). This was originally done using survey questions on surveymonkey but after receiving a few thousand results, the methodology seems flawed. Using Mechanical Turk has its downside though - many of the assistants simply ignore instructions, refuse to participate or fail to meet the requirements outlined above. There's really little recourse here except disqualifying them completely and starting over again until someone else accepts the HIT. However, given the sheer volume of people available via MTurk, the likelihood of finding some decent candidates shouldn't prove too difficult. Hopefully anyway! :)"

Keep track of your time carefully and use only the provided system, remember we need real people from different time zones working together globally which also means to avoid using slang terminologies like \u201cHey\u201d or \u201cYo,\u201d since it looks impersonal/unprofessional to the students you\u2019re assisting; keep in mind that they are writing their personal essay where they feel exposed by sharing important aspects regarding themselves including past mistakes. It\u2019s essential to provide them support and motivation. As much as humanly-possible you want to provide reassurance throughout all stages from creating the profile to the final evaluation by telling how great they are doing through every step of way especially during moments in struggle due to anxiety and stress that some can experience along with fear that comes with opening up emotional experiences that take courage to express to someone else who might judge or mock such topics rather than encouragement for sharing their feelings; therefore always focus on praising the student and providing solutions based on what\u2019s shared, never criticize. In addition, you\u2019ll notice often times the essays contain grammar errors which doesn\u2019t affect your scores at all for helping others in making corrections within the application form. Also, whenever the topic asks the user a specific question i.e.: What is one thing that has changed your life? Instead of directing them towards giving examples respond with, \u201cI would like to hear about yours?\u201d then ask open questions such as: \"Why?\"",

Thankyou!\n\nAnswer: You forgot a parenthesis `*` before the `n`. That is probably causing some sort of infinite loop due to having a recursion (infinite sequence), because each call for another level needs the result of previous level, but at same time tries to compute new value of that variable by using formula again, thus trying to find result for recursive case without actual data for next iteration which can never happen - resulting into stack overflow/memory allocation errors etc., even though in real world problem these issues might be much less apparent and hard to recognize until runtime error appears, making it easier to detect than many programming tasks we solve nowadays :)\nYou would want to fix such type of bug right away and then ask more about Haskell itself rather than specific details about the error you have received, so maybe it makes no difference if I write down exact explanation what caused said error or tell how you could improve yourself for better debugging experience overall :D",

However, let us review this problem statement with some additional questions about programming language theory before going forward... Do you understand how function declarations work (what the = operator is doing)? Are variables initialized correctly by using = (as opposed to assignment statements such as n:=4), do you use them only for temporary data storage within functions and avoiding reassignments from one place to another without explicit modification operations, what does * stand for (and when is multiplication needed at all, and where else could other operators be used to accomplish the same effect - i.e., is factorial defined via repeated multiplications of 1s and/or recursion), can you name and define two basic recursive approaches (for small and large inputs), which kind of loops can you think off to iterate through arrays etcetera and which type of data structures can they be applied on and when exactly? Also, can you define \"tail\" of lists (how to treat lists that end with no more elements) in both cases (Haskell or C++) so far and when exactly it becomes necessary, have you tried implementing list iteration functions already yourself based on your understanding, would you consider your own knowledge of recursion to be solid enough if you had never worked out algorithms recursively previously yet were given tasks that require you to write these functions manually nowadays even though most libraries come packed with standard functions to achieve these things, finally what was your major in school if any (and when were you taught this material) ... and yes, please go back and doublecheck that all these pieces are included properly inside their brackets too.

We then performed manual annotation using an expert panel consisting of both domain experts and crowd workers. This process was conducted in order to provide human verification and guidance during data collection so that quality could be maintained throughout the development phase. The annotation guidelines were based on existing datasets \\cite{Reddy18}, \\cite{Hahn19a}. A detailed breakdown of the number of unique question types used across all domains can be seen in Table~\\ref{table:question_types} along with their corresponding definitions. These categories may overlap slightly depending upon how they are worded. In addition, there will likely always be exceptions to these rules since each individual has different opinions regarding what is considered appropriate behavior online. However, this approach provides a strong baseline for our analysis in later sections. It should be noted however, that because of the relatively small size of our dataset ($<$65K), certain categories do not have many examples due to the rarity of those particular question types. Therefore, the categorization of question types might change if we had larger amount of training samples. Nonetheless, our current classifier shows promising results even",

The goal here was to collect feedback on how well assistants could handle non-factual questions with reasonable quality. In order to measure this, we asked two annotators to rate these conversations according to their usefulness at providing suggestions on what the user might want to do next, as well as assessing if there was potential for harm in any of the answers provided.\n\nIn terms of usefulness, we saw that our assistants were quite successful in suggesting things that did indeed point towards directions relevant to the topic at hand. Some key observations included the following:\n\\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\n\\item When dealing with negative sentiment, it appears that the task has been completed successfully when the assistant suggests taking time offline to relax and recharge. This indicates that the assistance component seems to recognize a problematic situation occurring and recommends waiting before continuing discussion. We will look into ways to strengthen the recognition abilities of our assistance component so that future assistants will more effectively identify situations that call for deescalation techniques.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nOn the flip"

            "1) You can get nutritional yeast flakes (it has no flavor on its own so it adds a cheese-like texture without taste), or you could try cashew nuts/macadamia nuts for grating them into \"parm\". For sauces made with creme fraiche etc., just add nutritional yeast to the mix before adding other ingredients - works well! \\textit{For vegans who avoid eggs too}, if using almond milk in place of cow\u2019s milk, you need an acidic substance added (such as lemon juice, apple cider vinegar or citric acid). If making fresh pasta, then leave out egg yolks completely, since they provide the protein structure necessary for elasticity in dough; however, if using store bought dry pasta, you do NOT have to worry about this. 2) It depends what you mean by parmesan substitute, but you can easily buy parmesan alternative from many supermarkets these days, including Linda McCartney and others which offer meat free options. These come powdered form usually. They will give similar results when sprinkled over food as real parmesan, especially melted over macaroni or spaghetti bolognese! Alternatively, you might consider eating non dairy pizza whereby you choose vegan pizzas or simply ask at a takeaway shop to replace normal cheeses with their equivalent non dairy option. Or there is always good old nutritional yeast (see above!) that you can shake onto almost anything, though maybe best left off desserts ;) Hope one of those suggestions helps! :)\n\\end{quote}\nThe first response provides detailed information on how to cook meals suitable for vegetarians, while providing ethically acceptable solutions to questions asked.

Other apps may allow you to convert videos into a GIF . However, they won't work well unless each frame has good light conditions.

Which countries speak Spanish ? Are there still some parts left to see if visiting Malaysia again? Which one has better view? Eiffel tower Or The Empire State Building In NYC ? Which part of China was more impressive to explore during the Great Wall Tour ? Would anyone like to share their opinion about whether they enjoyed it? Thankyou :) Where else will I go besides Sydney Harbour Bridge climb, Bondi beach and Opera House tour ? Where are you planning to travel next month ?\n\n\\subsubsection{Dialogue Rules} \\label{rules_dialogues} We formulate four types of dialogue rules, inspired by recent research into data collection systems \\cite{dhingra2020let}: \\\\[-4pt]\\\\[-8mm]\\noindent\\hspace{-7em}{\\textbf{Acknowledgement rule:} An Acknowledgeable statement includes ``Thank You\", \"Yes\" and similar polite words.

We use two different kinds of rewards, namely the 'expert score', which depends upon how many expertise tags a user has received and an overall performance score. The expert tag represents how much useful information was provided during a chat session and thus, determines the amount of reputation points awarded after each interaction. Our second reward is calculated based on whether our bot performed well or poorly over a set number of interactions. This provides us with valuable feedback regarding our bot\u2019s behavior. These scores are used to determine when a user should be promoted into becoming a human agent and when they should continue training until their expertise increases. Once again, both these rewards are updated based on real-time chats and serve as the primary mechanism to guide our RL agent towards good behaviors. More details can be found in Section~\\ref{sec:RL}. Figure~\\ref{fig:bot_performance} shows some of the metrics measured for each dialogue instance"

After completing these questions users advance again by pressing 'next'. This process continues until all the required data has been collected and users are ready to begin the actual conversation.

The topology provides immunity from decoherence \\cite{topo_qc} and hence TQC can be used to store information longer than classical computers. This makes them suitable for storing high quality information over large distances in space. However, one needs some robust method to create MFs. There exist several methods to do so but all these have drawbacks like sensitivity to disorder\\cite{topo_qc}. 2) Non Abelian Braiding \\cite{braid} of particles with exotic exchange statistics gives rise to anyon excitations and their properties determine if there exists a TQC. Anyons exhibit intriguing behaviour when interacted together through interchanging paths called {\\em braids}\\cite{braid}. Different types of interactions between anyons lead to different behavior of the system and hence determining how two arbitrary many anyons behave using this approach may seem difficult at first sight. But fortunately, it has been proven by Levin and Wen \\cite{LW1987, LW1988} that all kinds of local operations on anyons lead to same end result regardless of what kind of braided interaction they were originally created under; therefore all calculations involving arbitrary number of anyons can always be reduced to those involving just two of them, which we refer hereafter as elementary anyons. Elementary anyons are characterized either by integer spin values (Abelian case) or half integral spin values (non abelian case). They satisfy certain self consistency condition namely modularity where a set of anyons obey some conditions described below:\\\\ \\\\ $S^z$ = $\\pm z$ \\\\ $\\frac{",

Our goal was similar here: collect enough annotated data (we did not have too much time or budget resources). We decided to pay \\$5 each for questions with an average word count over ten words and upwards of \\$8 per question if it contained more than fourteen words or exceeded two hundred fifty characters. In addition, every user saw the following message at the beginning of the task: ``please try hard as best quality will be highly valued'' and again before starting on specific questions (\\autoref{fig:humanequality})(see also \\url{https://github.com/qapiprosject}). This resulted in almost ninety percent of all collected samples achieving excellent ratings. However this increased both cost due to the higher fees, but more importantly, required us to filter out bad submissions such as those made after many reloads/submits, low engagement rate indicative of bots, duplicate and off-topic ones.\nDescribe how good humans can do without AI, i.e., how accurate they were across the whole topic area during our experiments using MTurk?\n\nIn a small follow up study, we conducted another series of Mechanical Turker tests exploring whether it would indeed perform well enough so that a simple classifier could identify its mistakes compared against real experts which took more than one week total work and included 300 total tasks given through Mturk with hundreds of thousands of dollars paid in return.\nFor example, a sample human feedback on one response containing multiple sections described \"This sentence says the wrong thing\" followed by further comments explaining, \"first",

Such anyon gases were later shown using ultracold atomic gas experiments. In 3D, different approaches are used involving either artificially made materials or semiconducting devices; the former have proven challenging due to difficulties in controlling and detecting topologically protected excitations. A novel approach has been taken using semi conductor heterostructures where the band edge topology plays an active role rather then doping profiles or magnetism. There are now several groups reporting experimental results confirming various aspects needed in building fault tolerant universal TQC hardware. For the specific questions you asked I would refer you to literature reviews written about it.\nThe simplest ones can be found on wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%80%9CCooper_pair_box%E2%80%9D](Wiki article Copper Pair Box ), [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07511-w?WT\\.feedName=subjects\\_physical sciences\\%7CIOPA](Article on Majorana Fermions),[http://econdocs.oxfordjournals.org/content/79\\/4/R7] (Review Article Topological Superconductivity ) from Oxford Journals(OJ)\n\n\\textbf{How will society change during these coming decades?}\nIt depends if we live peacefully together.

In the case where they can work together (the most realistic situation) one can perform computation faster than by conventional methods such as gate based approach on semiconductor qubits due to reduced overhead needed in data processing/encoding etc.. There is an issue however with scaling them up. We will need a large number of anyons interacting to have more logical gates, so this is not easy task technologically speaking, even though theoretically everything looks great here too :) So, yes it is interesting technology but its hard to predict whether we can do much practical with these guys or just continue with gate model type of approach for some time...

Is there no other way?\n\nAssistant: Theoretically speaking, all kinds of materials can be used. But at present, researchers focus on superconducting wires made from bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide (BSCCO) which has very good thermal stability compared with traditional Niobium Tin Oxides(NTO). Also, the properties of BSCCO wires allow us to implement topological qubits without magnetic fields, which greatly simplifies the process of controlling these systems. This kind of wire also has a relatively large cross sectional area and its superconductivity transition temperature reaches around 90 K. These characteristics are very important when using this material to create long quantum circuits. As for practical applications, the first step would be realizing topological error correction. After successful implementation of topological error correction, people will find out whether or not topological computers are faster than their conventional counterparts. At present, the speed advantage is still uncertain because researches are currently only focusing on implementing one qubit, which requires a lot more time than the implementation of an ordinary qubit.\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=3.5cm]{topo_question_user_answer}\n\\caption{Example dialogue between user and assistant.}\n\\label{fig:dialogues}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAs shown above, our model achieves decent performance across various benchmark datasets, indicating its applicability to multiple domains.

Firstly, by extending our architecture to support additional modality types such as images \\",

We also see the response given back to the user in their input text box at line six; this can be seen highlighted on top of the transcript. Note how \\texttt{Snips}' answer attempts to understand some parts of the original question, such as ``field'' and ``statistics'' and provides links where relevant. However it has missed other key terms like ``braidings'', so these were then included in its response using keywords taken directly from the conversation history between human and system (highlighted in bold). It may seem odd that we need to manually teach an agent to say ``I don't know about XYZ'' but doing so will improve overall accuracy and quality over time, as well as allowing us to learn new vocabulary from the interaction itself. Finally, we observe two pieces of contextualised language that the agent used in order to better engage with the user; `please tell me more'; and `let\u2019s keep talking'. The latter helps the system recognise when it needs additional information and the former indicates a request for further explanation from the user. As described previously, the \\emph{response generation model} takes into account both previous interactions between humans and agents and internal data sources.

Take out the dog on regular walks so it can get some exercise, which will tire the dog and reduce his/her energy level and also prevent over-excitement. This may be helpful for avoiding unnecessary barking.\n3. Keep the dog happy by providing plenty of food bowls, chewable toys, balls, etc., especially during cold weather if the dog gets lonely.\n4. Never hit or scold the dog harshly, because this could cause the pet more stress. It might only lead to further aggression and negative behavioural patterns. Avoid hitting even if the dog has just urinated or defecate indoors - these things happen very often with young dogs. Instead try using an effective command such as 'sit', 'lie down'. These words work best. The key here is patience! Once the pup learns new commands from their owner after some time, then one day it will learn what's wrong about barking and how it needs to change its behavior.\n5. Do not ignore unwanted behavior, as doing nothing could eventually reinforce undesired behavior. Rather than ignoring bad habits completely, try redirecting the pet's attention towards good behaviors by offering appropriate rewards every now and again. For example, praise the dog whenever it listens to you carefully, stays calm at all times, or obeys your command well. Use words like `good`,`calm down`,`quiet`,etc.. The idea behind this approach is to positively reinforce desirable behavior while discouraging the undesirable one.\n6.

Choose one suitable for your pet; 2) It will let out a citronella smell (pup must have his nose on it), if he barks within two seconds after it released, otherwise just silence! But remember only use these when pup needs more training than most - for dogs who still need a bit more structure. Doing this repeatedly would reinforce the association between the noise and consequences so they learn to avoid making that sound again because they associate the reward with learning about how not to get punished; 3) Avoid using other spray bottles at home before and then reward him, praise and treat once done good without further issues; 4) For those aggressive towards strangers - you can practice by having someone else stand near you but away from dog, talk calmly through their gate until they quiet down, treating them every minute to encourage more attention and interaction rather than fear, distrust and reactivity, and repeating this over time. The stranger could always leave first instead; 5) Petsmart also sell these - check on eBay too since there might be better deals offered sometimes. Just keep trying different ones till he stops barking entirely whenever company is around... Hope we were able to help here in getting him trained right for family!

Take walks regularly and socialize it properly by meeting people, pets and new things daily so he gets familiarised early on and can avoid fear from strange sounds. Also teach it simple tricks such as sitting, fetching, stay etc so there isn\u2019t too much idle time when nothing exciting is going on. A tired dog tends to sleep rather than making unnecessary noise!  2. Give it its own room. Make sure that if your pup wants attention or space away, he knows how to communicate it through some whimper/sounds and will get rewarded for his effort even without physical interaction like playing a treat-dispensing ball or leaving them chewable toys (bones). The key here would be keeping up good behavior at home since noises could spill over to outside neighbors if kept unhappy and neglected all day long inside an empty house which can result in bad behaviors like barks due to stress & loneliness later down the line!\n\nAssistant: Do we have other similar questions related to 'how do i...'.

However, if you feel that your pet may be in pain then go ahead and give some comforting hugs and kisses!\n4) Take them outdoors where there isn't much activity so that they don't associate all the commotion from outside to barking inside. This will reduce their chances of becoming nervous/aggressive whenever someone passes by on the street.\n5) Avoid taking your dog anywhere crowded during training periods unless they have had plenty of exposure to large groups beforehand. Too many distractions can result in a lack of focus on learning how to obey quiet instructions.\n6) Play music near their kennels after dinner each night - dogs love classical music. The constant melody will prevent them from feeling isolated or lonely throughout the day, which can sometimes cause aggression towards family members due to stress-induced anxiety. It also helps develop social skills overtime.\n7) Lastly, take care of yourself first and always treat others kindly and with empathy; even if your animal companion doesn't respond immediately to your requests, it is important that they learn how to listen carefully. Never resort to hitting, scolding or otherwise hurting an innocent creature who is simply trying to understand what we want.

            "1-20. Pulling the inner fibers off tree trunks is an important first step in making bark into pulp for use in papermaking. In the next stage of production, workers will mix water with wood shavings until it becomes mushy, like oatmeal, before spreading it on large sheets made from linen. Then they let these materials sit for about half a day, allowing time for moisture absorption, before running them through beating machines known as \"hydrostats\" several times to further separate cellulose molecules from one another (think cotton candy machine). Next, manufacturers must add other substances, such as chlorine compounds or sodium hydroxide solutions (like lye), to turn their fiber blends into more useful pulps, such as bleached or acidified versions respectively used by many modern publishers and printers today.\n\nAnswer: This may have some good pointers, though I can\u2019t promise much given this site has only a handful of data points to go from;\nhttps://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-an-expert-system-and-a-bot"

Afterwards place some fibres between newspaper pages soaked with water and roll out flat. Leave overnight (it may take longer). Do this many times. Repeat until there isn\u2019t much left inside each layer of pulp. At first the paper will be white but then will turn brown after it has been used more often.

The inner part is white with black stripes, but only take off what will be used for the artwork (about 5cm thick). Then use the scissors to cut into squares about 4-6 cm each side. This way you can create small sheets at once without wasting too much material from the trunk. Once you have enough pieces of square shaped barks, start tearing them apart on all sides so they look more irregularly shaped and also unevened edges. Don\u2019t worry if they are too thin or there aren\u2019t many layers left inside \u2013 this will add up to texture later! Next step is soaking them in water until the fibers soften - about one hour works best for me. Then place these wet bark slices onto clean cloth which will absorb most of excess liquid when pressed together by hand. Use kitchen scale to measure how long did the bark last under pressure, since the final amount depends on the thickness/quality of individual papers. In my case I needed about half kilo of bark for making four A3 size papers. Finally let everything dry naturally in a dark room away from direct sunlight (a closet would do), otherwise they could shrink badly due to sudden changes in humidity. After drying time elapses carefully remove dried paper out of its supporting layer of cloth, peel it gently and smooth over with sandpaper before starting work.

The encoder part of our neural network has 8 hidden units, which is sufficient according to preliminary experiments. For decoding, we used greedy search with beam size of two; this ensured diversity without sacrificing quality too much. As mentioned previously, we do not train the generator explicitly but rather learn its parameters implicitly through reinforcement learning. This allows us to focus more on improving other aspects of the system like the reward functions and policy gradients.\nWe also tried training generators separately via supervised methods, e.g., maximum likelihood objective \\eqref{eq:ml}, and observed that the performance was worse than when trained end-to-end.\nIn particular, training a separate discriminator did result in better accuracy, however the overall F1 score was still lower compared to our proposed RL approach.\nAdditional results can be found in Appendix~\\ref{app:exp_details}. In summary, these additional findings support the claim that our proposed method outperforms traditional models.\nFinally, we note here that the generated answers were only used as feedback signals during training, i.e., we never presented them directly back to users nor included them in evaluation metrics.\n\n\\section{E"

A good place to start would be to ask yourself \u201cAm I currently in my room?\u201d or \u201cWhat color am I wearing right now?\u201c Then you will look around you and confirm with yourself if it matches. This works very well when using an alarm clock because when you wake up during the day, you can check whether you have really entered reality by asking yourself one of two questions \u2013 either \u201cIs there something different than last time\u201d or simply \u201cDo I feel rested\u201d. The latter could also be used for checking if you still sleeping after having awoken for a moment without realizing, or whether you actually woke up already. Also \\textit{\"Waking Up Exercise\"}- Whenever you decide to stop lying down in bed and stand up, you can test reality. Firstly, you check whether your surroundings match the environment wherein you were previously laying in your bed. Secondly, you can examine the objects within reach such as the table next to you, door handles etc., whether they seem familiar enough. Lastly, you can touch everything around you and listen carefully for noises, sounds, smells, tastes and textures. All three tests provide excellent proof against falling back asleep once again. In case all these fail, then perhaps you need more REM sleep and are likely to go straight back to sleep shortly afterwards. 3-Try to focus on how much pain you might feel upon getting hurt in your dream; you might"

It doesn't have to take too much time each day. But this helps us keep our attention focused on what we want, even if it is for a short moment every day. And this exercise trains the memory because the next day will require recall from previous days; thus helping improve mental concentration by developing long term memories and better memorization techniques through practice, and improving logical reasoning ability since most events in life involve causal connections with others, such as other people and/or animals and things. For example: A cat came up to greet you after seeing another cat in the yard and walking over toward the window. In writing down what happened in that exact order makes the process more fun when replayed again later that night while going to bed and imagining what was just seen throughout the whole day in chronological sequence like an exciting adventure story or film scene!

While falling asleep focus on trying to imagine yourself doing whatever reality proof you choose (either one of those suggested by the user above, or another). When imagining it do so very vividly; feel every detail of the sensations involved with performing the action. This will increase your chances at entering REM faster which increases your odds of getting lucid.

Answers\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAnswer: In order for someone to have a better chance of having a LD they need to practice WILD techniques. It stands for \"wake induced lunar dream\". There are many different methods but here is my favorite way of practicing. First off, you must train your body to fall back asleep if it wakes up. So basically, whenever you wake up from a nap or just lay around, force yourself to stay asleep. After about 15 minutes you should be able to do this without much effort. Next comes the actual training. Get ready for an hour or longer session where you will be lying there",
            "1. Try to remember your last dream before going to bed at night, then focus on it when waking up; this will increase the likelihood of entering the same dream again. 2. Before falling asleep, try visualising yourself doing things like playing basketball or driving a car. This helps with memory consolidation during REM cycles (when most dreams occur), which increases the chance for lucidity. Also, if you have trouble remembering your dreams upon waking, keep a journal by your pillow so you can write down what was happening immediately afterward without having to get out of bed - it makes it less likely that you forget anything important from those dreams! \\strong{IMPORTANT}: Make sure to set an alarm clock/phone timer every few hours throughout each nap period to remind you to wake yourself up, especially since napping may interfere with the quality of your nighttime rest.} 3) Keep track of your dreams using pen & paper, audio recorder, video camera...whatever you prefer. Whenever I start to fall asleep, i usually say my mantra 'i'm about to go to sleep, and im gonna remember all my dreams tonight'. It seems silly but it works. And also whenever u wake up, even if ur halfway between consciousness, record what just happened right away. 4) Do reality checks regularly throughout day, they train your mind to be aware of itself. The best one would probably be to ask someone who doesn\u2019t live there \u201cWhat city am I in?\u201d Then look around. Another good thing would be to do hand tests. For example touch the palms together, rub them back and forth really fast until they become warm, then check the other person\u2019s hands to see if their hands feel hot too. Repeat with feet. These are both great reality proof techniques, however the problem is people"

Also there is less vegetation at this time which makes it easier to see the birds through. But if I had to choose only one season then Autumn would be it since we get so many new arrivals from Siberia who migrate southwards all over Asia before they settle down for winter on our Indian shores. We also have an influx of resident waterfowl (ducks) here such as gadwalls, common teals etc who fly in huge numbers during these months along with waders like plovers & sandpipers too!

This approach uses both the dialogue history (i.e., previous turns) and the user utterance. The goal here is not only to predict whether a given response will fit the current situation but also what type of answer would suit this particular situation better \\cite{suhr_transformational_2018}\\cite{zhang2019contextualized}, so that the system could generate appropriate replies. There exist two major ways to model contextual knowledge, i.e., static models and dynamic models \\cite{suhr_transformational_2018}. Static models use all historical data at once whereas dynamic models update themselves by adding new data into their memory banks after each turn has been generated and processed. A simple example illustrates how these models differ. Suppose we have the following sequence of dialogues:\\\\\n$D_{1}$ = \\{A, B\\}\\\\\n$\\rightarrow$\\ \\{B\\} \\\\\n$\\rightarrow$\\ \\{E\\}\n\\\\\nwhere $A$, ..., E are different words. For instance \"Hello\", \"How do I get home?\" ,...,\"What is your name\" respectively. Then, if we were to use a static model to generate our next sentence then it might output \"What\". However with dynamic model we may expect to get \"What about my problem.\" This is because the"

Now given a point P= (u*cos(theta)+v sin(theta)), you move around from -1 unit all the way up to 4 units (increasingly longer distances). The force becomes a constant k*e^{((distance)/l)}. To find maximum repulsion (charge that could potentially escape), you must set this equal to zero and solve for distance x which comes out to x = l/(k log e). Once this amount of distance away from p has been found, we can put in our n=5 m=-1 into our equation above!\n\nBut when doing so, it gives us the wrong value; its too big due to rounding error I think but even when rounded down it just isn't right :( .

The first type (such as above) requires more effort than mere recall-knowledge. We designate these problem solving tasks with ``experiment\" since they require trial-and-error style interaction with multiple inputs and outputs. This will give rise to additional data points (input/output pairs) compared to recall knowledge trials when used on interactive tasks involving experiments. There has been little previous work done examining recalls for experimentation trials. However, we find it reasonable assumption given the increased complexity associated with new problems. As previously outlined regarding non-factual replies during human coding, the number of experimental trials needed depends upon the problem difficulty~\\cite{Ching2014}; this finding provides preliminary justification behind our decision to collect experimental trials. Our proposed approach allows users to provide meaningful contributions without having prior background knowledge about certain topics --- an important aspect which must be considered by future study designs.~\\footnote[2]{Note that the number of factual versus non-factual statements also varies among participant groups according to whether their parents were academics who specialised in science fields.} An overview flow chart is provided in Figure~\\ref{flowchart}.

            "230 days ago on average, with no clear peak at certain dates like exams, tests, midterms, finals, holidays, birthdays, graduations... I have found people to be most willing to do homework/study sessions around weekends and Mondays though! The highest rate seems to be around Saturday afternoons and Monday nights, followed by Thursday mornings for study sessions! For test/exam periods however there seem to be two main times: first one right after classes begin during freshman year, where everyone gets excited about doing things \"legit\" because they are still new and unsure; then again once all their friends get sick from staying up too late and drinking, just before an exam or quiz which requires studying, and lastly (this varies based off course load) just prior to major project due dates - typically 1-5 weeks depending upon professor requirements and graded percentages assigned! In short: people who work together are likely going to form study groups to finish their group assignments ahead of time and then later, after deadlines have passed but projects are not yet complete will find ways to either crush through their individual assignments themselves so as not to delay finishing class projects altogether, OR ask each other for copies/scans/past notes if need be until projects are finished completely and ready for turn-in/presentation etc.. The majority of people only copy and paste small parts here and there from Google search results such as \"sample lab report template,\" or even just take the structure provided to them within a rubric, word count limitations and format requirements provided via instructor email. Aside from that students may look online and copy textbook passages into Powerpoint presentations to read verbatum directly off of their screen while teaching a concept without rewording whatsoever - this also occurs during speeches/oral presentation courses and often leads to",

This comes up frequently in security, for example: you might be capable of doing things like using another person's login details to get access into some systems without authorization -- this would normally count as breaking whatever terms there were over usage. However, this could also involve theft or coercion or blackmail... and those tend to come under laws that apply beyond simply contract law, which covers how people agree with each other regarding behavioral restrictions such as who has authority over data etc.."

It looks like there might be some more info about this chatbot at https://www.coursera.org/learn/conversational-ai - maybe try reaching out on their forums? Good luck :)\n\nAnswer: This isn\u2019t a chat bot per se but a natural language processing (NLP) tool used by researchers studying how people communicate with machines via textual messages. There aren\u2019t many bots like these because they take significant effort to create; even simple conversations between two users can be challenging if each user uses different phrasing than the other one did during training time. As an example, I was involved with building [Eve](https://eveondemand.com/) which had very advanced capabilities and took us months just to build. But Eve didn\u2019t do what your NLU program appears to be doing, so we\u2019re looking at different codebases here. In particular, I would expect your codebase has no built-in rules to prevent users from saying things such as \u201ccheats\u201d without quotation marks around them, thus confusing the parser into thinking the word \u201ccheated\u201d is part of its dictionary rather than simply referring to another action verb. That\u2019s also why your response seems off-the-wall sometimes since the software doesn\u2019t understand the difference between asking \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite movie?\u201d vs \u201cWhat movies do you prefer\u201d. These sorts of differences can often lead to poor experiences where someone says X then gets told Y in reply \u2013 that may work fine if you\u2019re playing chess against Deep Blue, but less well in a human context. The good news though is that all this means your NLU engine needs \\em{much} better quality data before it will ever start to function correctly, especially if",
            "2018-10-30T19:54:16Z - Cheating can be defined differently depending on what type of situation one might find themselves in. It all depends if there will be negative consequences for them doing so (like getting caught), whether they were asked to do so by someone else who had an advantage over them etc. There\u2019s no such thing as \u2018always\u2019 but rather situational context based decisions that have to made with regard to their own ethics. In short though; never intentionally take credit for another person\u2019s work/ideas unless they explicitly allowed you to claim ownership yourself. That would constitute plagiarism. But other than that I guess there aren\u2019t many rules here...\n\nAnswer: \\strong{When it comes down to \"cheating\", there really isn't much of a rulebook.} The closest thing we could compare this too would be copyright law. A quick Google search yields some [results](https://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/) for treaties about copyright, which gives us a little insight into how different countries deal with copyright violations. This [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright) also has quite a bit of information. From my reading of these sources, the only clear rule seems to be that if someone copies part or whole of your original creation without giving due credits then that is indeed stealing.\n\nBut once again, since the world of academia is far more complex, I am sure each institution follows its own set of policies regarding plagiarism and intellectual property rights. And since universities vary widely in size and resources, those policies tend to differ wildly from place to place.\n\nComment: So, even though you're technically 'stealing', copying code verbatim wouldn't get anyone banned at school"

The advantage here over digital mirror arrays (DMA) like those used in most cinemas today, is that they can create a more detailed image since the light produced is continuous rather than flashing on and off - meaning that there\u2019s no flickering effect. This also means that the image will stay sharp at higher frame rates. Since the image isn't created using millions of tiny mirrors each time, it\u2019s much cheaper to run too \u2013 up to five times less energy intensive when compared to other technologies, according to Cinionic who make laser systems. There\u2019s no need to replace bulbs either, making long term maintenance costs considerably lower! Lasers aren\u2019t just easier on the eye though; \\strong{. They can handle larger screen sizes}, creating clearer images across wider spaces than competitors do. In particular, the high contrast makes it ideal for huge curved screens, bringing immersion levels beyond anything we currently see in movie houses.\n\nAnswer 2: Cinema laser projects pictures directly from one source onto the film, whereas some modern theatre projectors use Digital Light Processor Technology(DLP), which uses millions of",
            "1) The light emitted by an arc lamp (a high voltage electric current passing through gas within a glass tube), which contains various colors in the visible spectrum such as red green blue yellow white violet etc., passes through several lenses and then hits onto three LCD panels aligned horizontally on top of each other. 2) Each panel has color filters attached at their backside, which allow only one type of light wave length to pass through them for display onto the screen. 3) A computerized microchip embedded inside each LCD panel controls the intensity level at which this single wavelength passes through them during its entire life span so that no variation happens in brightness. 4) As the beam enters into these panels the image gets split up into three separate beams with different colored lights, namely RGB. These are sent to different mirrors located outside the room, where they get reflected towards the actual projector itself. 5) Now these reflectors have thousands of small movable mirrors inside each one of them and they can move individually according to what signals are fed to them. They thus bounce around the room very quickly creating numerous projections all over the walls and ceiling and thereby displaying images in every corner of the auditorium. This process continues till end of movie duration and once it ends there is no more signal flowing through the device hence nothing moves anymore until another movie starts playing again. Thus, here we see that the whole operation involves complex optical mechanism for producing amazingly realistic pictures which do not distort much even after hitting against hundreds of surfaces because these reflections travel directly back and forth and never change directions before reaching our eyesight. However, if anything changes in brightness anywhere along the pathway then the quality will reduce automatically but overall viewing experience would still remain fine. So basically it\u2019s just like watching TV except that it uses big powerful bulbs instead of little CFL"

Mostly used for business presentations indoor settings with few people in them, such as seminar halls and conference rooms; these devices may use two kinds of LEDs, red green blue (RGB) and single-chip designs, which respectively use three separate diode chips per pixel, and just one chip combined into pixels through optics.

Although LED displays cannot compete in size and quality as compared to Laser Diodes (LDs)-based ones, they still stand among top ranking projectors on market today because of portability ease, less heat production rate, power consumption efficiency and maintenance costs along with their affordable pricing tags.

            "The first part I have explained already at some other post, but this is for more detail on how things are working.  Basically all cinema projectors work with the following principles : Light Source --> optics -> reflector / transmissive mirror -> image screen --> lens -> image projected on wall /screen/movie etc.... The only difference between different systems like LASER and RGB light sources lies mainly within their operation mode, and hence what happens behind these two elements. Let me describe the same by explaining about DLP chip which we usually see in consumer TVs. DLP chip contains micro mirror array. When current flows through this chip then every individual tiny element inside (referred as \"pixels\") can tilt itself to reflect red color light coming through blue LED back into viewer direction when \"1\" value passes though OR alternatively block this reflection completely when no data present in RAM i.e.\"0\". Hence one single pixel acts like shutter in front of the Red colored bulb (which provides actual visible output) such that either Red bulb can illuminate its surrounding environment depending upon presence or absence of corresponding value of binary data stream provided over input terminal of said DMD Chip via VGA port cable connection . So each tiny component (element ) acting individually controls amount of energy (Red + Blue combination = white color)... In simple terms it behaves exactly like shutter opening up to let ray pass towards outside world and closing down blocking passage if value received through USB/HDMI cables doesn\u2019t provide corresponding logic values... So the above description will apply perfectly fine for any device which works similar to above concept be it home theater system or movie hall system..... And here comes our discussion regarding lasers versus regular RGB lights .. Now if the laser beam was directed perpendicularly towards those pixels and there was some way of detecting changes taking place within each micro component(as mentioned before), than they would",
            "The basic difference between both systems is their operation mechanism - with the digital micromirror devices (DMDs), we can generate the light using the light emitting diodes which reflects through a micro-mirror chip (or projectors). Whereas on Laser projected ones there isn\u2019t much requirement for bulbs as these operate via excitation medium \u2013 phosphorus lamp/Laser light. Also the lifetime of LED lights aren\u2019t as great compared to those operated by the Phosphorus lamp or even the Lasers where the lifetime can go up till few hundred hours! Moreover when the lamps die they produce quite high levels of UV radiations, thus leading them more hazardous. With laser projection we get the same picture quality as obtained in DMPs, however at a greater price! We need higher amount of maintenance in this one because its expensive components needs specialized attention & handling, so also it takes less time before our machine stops working than normal LCD ones due to shorter lifespan. And the other reason for cost increase was due to use of higher quality materials required during construction & assembly like optical filters and polarization films used along the beam path etc... However recently, most of these manufacturers have shifted back towards LED illumination systems and started integrating these technologies into new machines and I hope the future holds good prospects in this direction.. Hope I could satisfy ur queries regarding differences between both technologies ! Thankyou!! Have an amazing day ahead!!! :-)"

            "Cinema Laser Projection Systems (CLPS) uses RGB light sources and red, green, blue, yellow and cyan phosphors for color mixing to generate the colors needed for an image display. These systems are very energy efficient with high lumen output. A single lamp can illuminate more than one projector simultaneously without any increase in heat load on the projected surface.\n\nThe key advantage of CLPS over traditional Digital Light Processing (DLP)-based solutions lies in its ability to provide consistent color temperature across all primary colors (RGB). This results in a higher contrast ratio which provides a much better viewing experience at large venues such as stadiums where brightness requirements tend to be stringent. Another benefit is the lack of a shutter mechanism since no motion picture film reel is used; this translates into reduced maintenance costs due to fewer moving parts and also helps in eliminating artifacts like flash frames and jitter associated with digital intermediaries between the source signal and screen. The most common types of these technologies use solid state devices for modulation and demodulation. They employ two optical pathways through a liquid crystal panel or LCD panels and mirror arrays for switching. Each optical channel contains an independent light source that allows them to be combined or switched off independently to achieve full black levels when required. However, the biggest disadvantage of these systems is their requirement for specialized ambient conditions, including proper ventilation, low humidity, dust free environment etc., because they cannot function under harsh environments and therefore have limited applicability.\n\\end{code}",
            "3LCD Lasers create an image by splitting white light into three primary colors (red, green & blue) with mirrors on their paths and then projecting these through LCoS devices onto the screen at varying intensities to form an image. It uses more than one type of color wheel. This is known as \"RGBCW\" because red, green and blue wavelengths of light all come together when they reach the glass surface which splits them again so that only RGB reaches our eyes and we see it as White Light.\nThe 2nd generation laser based projection systems use two laser modules each for Red Green Blue, making four lasers altogether. These systems can produce higher lumens but also require additional cooling components such as fans/heat sinks. They do not need bulbs and lamps, unlike other technologies like LASER Phosphor. The most recent models now have LED panels embedded within the chip itself and do not even require cooling units. However, there may be some heating issues if the projectors run continuously for hours without break. Also, there is no standardized protocol between the projectors themselves yet, though there might soon be an industry standard developed very soon. So far, Sony has been the leading player here since its introduction in the marketplace in early 2017. I will add further details later about this technology and my personal experience with the products after working with many types over several years. Thanks!"

            "The light source for both types is an RGB laserdiode array with a wavelength of about $406$ nanometres ($nm$). This beam is then collimated by passing through lenses which expand its size. The next step would be the spatial modulator (DMD). A digital signal processor takes care of this part. It sends a series of binary signals to each LED individually so they can turn on/off at will, thus creating patterns like lines, triangles etc.. The patterned laserbeam then goes through a dichroic mirror, where it reflects towards two separate optical paths depending on what colour it has been sent out in. The first path contains all the blue components and passes them onto another set of optics which send it directly into the projector lens. The second path is composed only of red & green components. These pass again through a dichoic mirror but this one directs their respective colours onto two other dichoic mirrors placed perpendicularly to each other. After these last two steps we obtain three separate beams; blue, red&green respectively. All the rays now go back together via the same optical train until they reach a single screen.\n\n\\section{Explanation}\n\nThe following is my attempt of explanation of user\u2019s response using [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7X3KV159I&ab_channel=LaserProjectionTutorial) video I found on YouTube.

            "1) A laser light source projects an image onto a mirror which reflects the beam into a lens. The lens focuses this reflected beam through a spinning disk with microscopic holes (called a spatial light modulator). This SLM has a pattern on its surface that corresponds to each pixel in the projected image. As the laser passes through these tiny holes, they block some of the light and allow other parts to pass through. These patterns create the pixels for the final image.\n2) The next step involves using another set of optics to magnify the image so that it can be displayed at full size on the screen. Finally, the image reaches the last optical element before reaching the audience - the projection lenses. They enlarge the image again and send it out towards the viewers.\n3) Laser projection systems have several advantages over traditional lamp-based ones. Firstly, there\u2019s no need to replace bulbs every few months because lasers never burn out. Secondly, since there aren\u2019t any moving parts involved, the risk of failure due to mechanical wear and tear is eliminated. Thirdly, laser projection offers higher contrast ratios than conventional technologies. Last but not least, laser projection systems consume less power compared to their counterparts.\n4) In addition to all those benefits, laser projection also allows for more flexibility when designing cinemas. For example, screens can now be curved without compromising picture quality. Also, theaters can use smaller rooms thanks to the reduced space required by laser projectors.\n5) However, one disadvantage of laser projection is that it requires specialized equipment such as high-powered lasers and cooling devices. Therefore, installing them may prove costlier than setting up a standard digital cinema. Another drawback is that laser projection isn\u2019t compatible with older film formats like IMAX.\n"

            "1) I believe there is no such thing like 'obligation'. Obligation exists only between humans because it is an agreement between two people which has its own rules (or laws). There can be no agreements without one party doing some action (giving consent), but once this happens there will always exist both rights and duties for each individual - i.e. one person must do certain things according to those agreed upon terms/conditions and another party cannot ask anything from him beyond what was previously consented by both parties involved. \\strong{Therefore, our duty towards a deceased person would not matter anymore.} However if someone wants to honour his memory then it becomes their personal choice. We usually want others to remember us after death so that they think about how much they loved us during life!

This whole conceptualization is completely manmade anyway :P\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item 2) The word \"obliged\" here means to be grateful. Whenever someone helps me out, I feel indebted to them and therefore try to return the favour whenever I can. It doesn't really mean having to repay anyone back though.

We must remember though that we ultimately only control ourselves \u2013 not other individuals - so we shouldn't let others hold power over how we feel; this will eventually cause us suffering and pain.

This method was employed in previous works with good results (\\textit{e.g.} \\citet{Duong:2017}). In order to assess the system\u2019s ability to detect users' sentiments accurately, we also compared the generated scores against the ones computed using Linguistic Inquiry Word Count software (\\textsc{LIWC}) which computes emoticons, opinions, cognitive processes and affective terms present within sentences. As suggested previously, a lower score indicates higher accuracy at recognizing human emotion~\\cite{Pradhan:2018}, hence a lower ER metric implies better system performance. For instance, if a dialogue session ends up with the following interaction sequence between both parties, then the emotion recognition rate will be $\\frac{4}{5}$. \\\\[0pt]\n$\\bullet$ Human: \"I am happy today.\"\\\\[-3ex]\n$\\bullet$ System: \"\\textcolor{blue}{\\textbf{Thank you}}!\"\n\n\\begin{table}[h!]\\centering\n{\\scriptsize\n\\caption{Human-Agent Conversation dataset}\n\\vspace{-0.6cm}\n\\setlength\\tabcolsep{4 pt}\n\\",
            "10. We do not owe anything to anyone who has died; however it may be beneficial for us if they were kind enough during their life time so that after death people would pray for them (to God). In other words, one must perform good deeds with this hope in mind -that when he/she dies others will pray on his behalf- since our reward depends on Allah alone but we can gain extra blessings through others\u2019 duaas (prayers) and charity towards our family members and relatives even after our death. So yes, I believe that we have some duties towards those who have passed away from among our parents, spouses, children, etc. For example, my grandmother used to feed beggars whenever she had the chance because she wanted to benefit her own children by having someone praying for them in the Hereafter. However, we shouldn\u2019t take advantage of this idea. That means we cannot kill another person just so he could give us a reward in Paradise! Rather, it only refers to performing good acts like helping poor neighbors and such which we often tend to ignore. Also, let me tell you about a beautiful tradition regarding this topic narrated by Prophet Muhammad \\strong{\ufdfa} himself\u2026..

The common belief is that there were three types of mammals that started the process of branching out into other animals; namely primates like humans, rodents like rats and squirrels and carnivores like cats and dogs. This means that these branches would eventually become all kinds of creatures including bats, horses, whales etc\u2026 All of them are believed to descend from one ancestral group with some going through extinction along the way. 3) One major thing about raccoons however is that they can climb trees really well thanks to the structure of their front limbs. They also tend to eat mostly fruit and vegetables unlike most members of the dog family who hunt for meat. The reason I am choosing this particular response though is that I do believe that raccoons are close to the same level on the evolutionary chart compared to pandas.\n\nAssistant: Ok, thank you so much!\n\\end{code}",

Both seem wrong since the Red panda is indeed an ancestor of Raccoons but not directly related so this seems biologically incorrect.

So the rule can catch such typos by requiring some specific form at this position regardless. It also helps if someone doesn't spell something exactly right; i.e. there isn't always just a single unique \"right\" way to express the same thought in words so even when everything else seems perfect there could still potentially be some issue because what they actually wrote didn't quite match how it was understood by those designing the NLP models behind this sort of feature! Hence it may need a separate piece of processing code designed specifically to handle such things...and in general you often find people doing different variations like `\"is this\", \"do these\" etc....to cover off various common possibilities...or simply including examples along the lines of \"\\strong{what does x mean?\"}, where `x` itself contains wildcard characters...just so nothing is ever accidentally misinterpreted in future releases ;-) .

But there\u2019s nothing particularly similar between these two orders besides the shared presence of some furry animals. Red Pandas look like small bears with very fluffy coats and raccoons are basically large cute bandits with pointy teeth but I have never seen anything like either animal in real life before. It\u2019s kinda difficult to choose between them since they aren\u2019t closely related to each other genetically. Raccoon are definitely more intelligent than most other species and this trait could potentially put them higher up the hierarchy among their fellow mammals, including primates who often use tools. In addition to all those cool skills mentioned above such as dexterity and adaptability they also tend to learn fast because their brain is very active so maybe that will count for them in our conversation here! I am guessing the same can probably apply to \\textbf{Pygmy marmosets} even though it isn\u2019t always obvious due to how little attention humans usually give them... but what else would one expect if someone only learns about new stuff after googling?

Pandas are actually bears and their closest relative is the spectacled bear which belongs to the same family (Ursidae) whereas red pandas do not have many similarities at all to other species besides the ring-tailed lemur which also lives in trees and eats bamboos like them. However, I am quite sure there will still be lots of people who think it looks much more like a panda than anything else. That's because of its fur coloration, facial markings, small size, etc.. It may seem cute to call it 'panda bear', especially when children can see the similarity between this animal and real giant pandas, but from an academic perspective, these animals shouldn't really be compared at all. Red pandas look very different and belong to a totally separate order - Ailuropodidae versus Ursidae - so technically speaking we would need another name for this unique mammal if we wanted to use the scientific nomenclature system. So what's the right term then? Some zoologists say red pandas aren't even close enough to actual giant pandas to justify using such a name and others prefer to simply keep calling it a 'red panda'. What about you though? Which one sounds better to you personally; red panda or just plain old red? I myself would choose \"red\" since I find \"red panda\" too confusing for non-experts and might confuse someone into thinking they were talking about the real thing when referring to our new friend here.

But this wasn't really true; clip just fell off the backside when the lid shut down after i threw away all those old files of mine.... And then clippy explained how he got stuck in here. He said bonzi pulled him by accident but because they were too close to the edge, they couldn't get out anymore without hurting themselves first. Since then they tried many times to escape, but each attempt ended badly.. With every move they made came an increasingly loud crunching sound until finally, they decided to give up trying altogether since nothing seemed to go right anyway. However, today everything suddenly changed thanks to my incredibly bad luck. Now they needed to find a way out quickly because if they didn't manage to do it fast enough, soon the housekeeper would come to check whether anyone had already vacuumed the living room carpets yet, which meant she might discover them. Oh no!!! Not only did they need to figure out how exactly one can avoid ending up in such situations again, but also how to slip away quietly while nobody else was looking. Suddenly, bonzi pointed to a small hole next to him. That must have been where he managed to hide earlier, but it looked too narrow for him to crawl through himself let alone drag another person along with him who is even larger than he is.

One of them said \"We come in peace\" then the other one said \"Take us to your leader\". So we went outside where I saw this huge spaceship hovering over our house. The door opened and another alien stepped down onto the ground. It was so tall that its head touched the clouds. Its eyes glowed red and it had three fingers on each hand. We walked towards the ship and got inside. There were lots of buttons and levers everywhere. Suddenly the ship took off and flew through space faster than anything else ever has before. After what seemed like hours, we landed on an unknown planet. When we exited the ship, we found ourselves surrounded by hundreds of strange creatures. Some of them were very small and others were much bigger than humans. All of them had different colors and shapes. As soon as they noticed us, they began running around screaming and shouting.

There are various methods used for authentication such as passwords, biometrics (e.g., fingerprint, face recognition), digital certificates, smart cards etc. 2) Access Control \u2013 Limits who has rights to do what on an object e.g. files/folders in case of a file system; directories in case of operating systems. It ensures the confidentiality and integrity of objects. Various access control mechanisms like ACL based, Capability-based, Rule Based, Mandatory Access Control, Discretionary Access Control exist in different platforms.  3) Availability \u2013 Ensuring the availability of service so that authorized users have easy and timely access to it without compromising other factors related to confidentiality and integrity. In simple terms, this means \u201cThe right people get the right things at the right time\u201d.  4) Cryptography \u2013 An important technique which is widely used in the context of cybersecurity wherein cryptographic algorithms are utilized to convert plain text into encrypted format. This also includes conversion of cipher texts back into their original state through encryption. 5) Data Security\u2013 A set of techniques designed by experts to safeguard critical business assets against all types of malicious activities including unauthorised use and modification. For instance, there might be multiple copies of same piece of information but one copy may be required to be protected with high level of secrecy because of its sensitivity, whereas others could be made available to general public. 6) Firewall \u2013 A device which allows controlling traffic entering & leaving the private networks.

It also includes preventing cyber-attacks on infrastructure like power grids, air traffic control networks.  4) Authentication verifies user identity based upon credentials provided by user at login time which may contain different forms depending upon sensitivity level required for the system. The goal here is twofold \u2014to provide only proper authorized users with access rights to critical resources and to minimize risk of intrusion into these sensitive assets. 5) Authorization defines what actions a given user account will have access to. It provides protection against unauthorized usage of IT resources and prevents improper disclosure of business secrets through policies enforced within applications and servers. 6) Nonrepudiation refers to guaranteeing that a piece of evidence cannot be denied after its existence was proven; it can serve as important legal proof during investigation process. For example, when a transaction takes place, both parties need to prove that it actually happened so no one could later claim he never made such payment because he didn\u2019t want to.

            "The fundamental concept of information security includes four important factors; availability, integrity, confidentiality and non-repudiation (Clarke & Gallacher, 2016). Information Availability is ensuring the availability of system resources such as CPU power and storage for processing, transferring, receiving or retrieving the requested services (Durayappah et al., 2013) by minimizing disruptions and preventing interruption when providing services (Zhou & Luo, 2017), and enabling authorized access (Shukla & Mishra, 2014). In terms of confidentiality, users\u2019 private data needs to be kept protected at all times and this is accomplished through authentication techniques such as password management which restricts accessibility to particular parties (Fang & Yuan, 2018); therefore only approved persons will have authorization over these types of assets. Data Integrity involves verifying that digital documents and records cannot change during transfers or manipulation within a system due to accidental error (Taouli, Elkhoury, Abdelhadi & Dandashi, 2019), intentional changes or external intrusions without the permission of owners or designated authority figures. Lastly Non Repudiation guarantees proof that electronic signatures, actions performed online, etc...were authenticated and were executed under appropriate permissions by its creator (Jha, Jha, Chakrabortty, Prakash, Sarkar, Sahu, Rai, Mohapatra & Singh, 2015). This concept provides protection against potential forgery attacks (Pandey & Ahmad, 2015) because there exists no doubt on whether it was legitimate action.

An ISMS also provides guidance on handling and processing sensitive company and customer-related data and ensures its availability when needed. Information Security Management Systems are defined under ISO/IEC27000 series standards as management practices used to manage risks related to confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of information processed through IT infrastructure; these are often known simply as \u201cInformation Security\u201d. \\strong{ISO 27000} has published many guidelines, standards, certifications etc., which have been accepted globally for their practical applicability to secure organizational assets against potential threats such as cybercrime, industrial espionage, hacking attempts and more recently ransomware attacks.\n\nAnswer: In general terms there are two kinds of Information Security threats: internal and external. For example, someone may accidently erase files due to carelessness. Or a virus could corrupt the data. Both of those are considered internal threats because the person doing it was inside the organization - he didn\u2019t come over the network with his malicious intentions! On the other hand, if somebody tried to gain unauthorized access into the server room or attempted to get access remotely without authorization then we would consider them as external threat actors. It depends what kind of environment do you work in \u2013 corporate offices vs military base \u2013 but regardless both need some sort of protection mechanism in place so people won\u2019t steal sensitive data.

            "1) Information Security - Information security involves keeping information away from people who do not have authorization for it. It also ensures that only authorized users gain access through authentication procedures and that the system remains operational at all times. 2) Protect Sensitive Data- Protection of sensitive personal and financial data such as credit cards numbers and social security number has become one of the most important aspects of IT infrastructure development. This is because these kinds of data are very valuable and can lead to identity theft if stolen by unauthorised individuals. Therefore, companies must take necessary measures so that no third party gains access to this kind of confidential data without permission from its owner/holder. 3) Threat Management- A major part of an effective information security strategy involves risk assessment with regards to threat management. Companies need to identify what their biggest risks and threats are before implementing strategic plans for managing them. They also need to consider whether existing technologies can effectively address those risks or whether new solutions will have to be developed. 4) Vulnerability Assessments - The next step after identifying potential security issues within the organisation is performing vulnerability assessments on different devices connected into the network. This helps determine which ones pose the greatest risks and need to be protected more efficiently. 5) Risk Mitigation Strategies \u2013 In many cases, organisations may find out during testing phases that there\u2019s already too much risk associated with some of the technology they currently use. To mitigate this type of issue, businesses might implement additional safeguards like firewalls or intrusion detection software. They might even replace certain pieces with newer versions designed specifically for enhanced safety features. 6) Backup Plans & Disaster Recoveries- Business owners cannot predict when a natural disaster might strike and wipe out all their records.

            "1) Confidentiality - The principle of confidentiality ensures that only authorized individuals have access to specific types of information. This means that unauthorized users cannot view this information. For example, if an employee has access to customer credit card numbers but no other employees do, then he/she must keep these numbers private.\n2) Integrity - The integrity principle requires that all information remains accurate and complete at all times. It also states that it is important for organizations to maintain their records so that they remain consistent over time. For instance, when a company updates its database with new customers\u2019 names and addresses, it needs to ensure that those changes are reflected accurately on every record.\n3) Availability - The availability principle refers to making sure that critical business resources (such as databases, applications, networks, etc.) are always accessible by authorized personnel. In order to achieve this goal, companies need to implement measures such as backup power generators, redundant network connections, and multiple servers.\n4) Authentication - The authentication principle involves verifying whether someone who claims to be a certain person actually is that individual. Organizations use various methods to authenticate people including passwords, PINs, biometrics, smart cards, tokens, digital certificates, and more.\n5) Non-repudiation - The non-repudiation principle prevents parties involved in transactions from denying having performed them. To accomplish this task, organizations often rely on electronic signatures, which provide proof that a particular user signed off on a document.\n6) Accountability - The accountability principle makes sure that everyone within an organization knows what tasks they are responsible for performing. By assigning roles and responsibilities to each member of staff, managers can hold workers accountable for completing assigned duties.\n7) Audit trails - An audit trail consists of logs that track activities related to system usage. These logs may contain details"

The real root cause will come from somewhere before those lines shown. A simple first step would probably be to look closer at the constructor call, since if passed null then obviously anything derived/built upon such an object cannot have an non-null property. Maybe check that all fields declared in constructors actually get assigned values during creation...\n\nAnswer: It looks like `agent.start()` did not initialize the Agent instance properly because someone had provided Agent.class name and null Object reference ,so this error occured and next time just follow exception stacktrace to narrow down on originating location.",

Even though there are companies which build assistants using public online sources only, most of the times those chatbots get trained over time (just like human conversation partners improve their \"communication skills\" through the interactions), therefore if implemented properly, the new version of the bot could eventually behave just as humanly :)\nThanks again for contributing!!

            "1) It depends on how big this organization is and what type of services it offers/sells. For example, an online shopping website would need all departments under one umbrella so they can work closely together. However if its a manufacturing company, then each department could operate separately because there won't be much interaction between them (unless its about purchasing goods). In short I think yes, splitting up is beneficial but again it really depends!\n2) Yes, sometimes when things get too complex with multiple branches working on separate projects, having a smaller team focused on specific tasks helps keep the project running smoothly and efficiently.\n\nAnswer: \\strong{No}\nIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you have a single unit doing everything or many units doing different jobs; both models will require some kind of communication and cooperation among those various groups.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Splitting up a large company has two major benefits. First off, managers at every level become better able to focus their time and attention where needed most within their particular area of responsibility\u2014and thus more effective leaders. Secondly, breaking apart a conglomerate makes it easier to sell off individual divisions whose prospects look weakest. That means management isn\u2019t tied down supporting laggards, which allows resources to be devoted to growing strong businesses.\n\\end{itemize}"

            "I want an app where it takes photos every few minutes. This could be useful when there are two people talking who may not see each other very often but live far apart so they can stay connected. Whenever someone takes out their phone (even if they are already on Facebook), they would open this application, then choose one friend at random from all those on Facebook that also have installed this same app, which would show both parties a picture taken of themselves at least three seconds ago, with some text such as \"hey\". They can decide what they wish to say about said photo/snapchat by clicking the text button or tapping their screen depending upon the type of device. It could possibly add the date & time underneath too, or simply the time stamp like in most SnapChat messages sent through smartphones nowadays?! This would enable users to take a snapshot whenever without even needing internet access due to having previously been given the image from the previous snap shot and sending that to the user of interest beforehand, meaning it can just save images rather than sending them. Then if someone doesn\u2019t respond after around 5 snaps or whatever set number you pick within settings (to stop anyone going overboard), perhaps you send them a reminder saying \u2018remember me :'( or whatever you fancy\u2026 Or even maybe an automatic response such as \u2018are we friends yet :(\u2018 until someone finally accepts, because nobody likes getting ignored especially by a complete stranger lol ;) The point behind it would probably mainly revolve around friendship making. I guess if I were ever lonely whilst traveling away somewhere I could easily contact strangers whom seemed friendly based on our similar interests displayed online.

And \\em{\"assistant\"} will refer to an algorithm/program that tries to provide assistance on the website (i.e., trying to understand natural language questions).\n\nSo here is how you could do it:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Whenever there is new data (in our case, when users post new text messages) - feed them into the model. This way, every time someone asks \"How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood\", your assistant will be able to learn from all previous examples, including yours!\nThe problem here though, is that sometimes you want to give different feedback depending on who posts the message. So maybe you don't want to train the assistant based off the first few words of the message? Maybe the assistant needs additional context? For instance, if you were asking me whether I wanted tea or coffee after dinner, I might ask for a cup of tea even though it'll take longer than just having coffee because... well.. because I like tea better :)\nBut now you see that training models without understanding their inner workings isn't so easy...\n\\item Now comes the hard part: figuring out which features matter.

So for example:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Ask me about computers / computing hardware, and then ask again in three days and you won\u2019t hear the same exact reply, as most good chatbots keep track of what has been asked previously, learn and remember from past exchanges. They may even tell you off!

But",
            "10) I don\u2019t understand this one, so how about I try explaining it. Building bombs require many components and chemical reactions that may result into an explosion. A few ingredients used for making these deadly devices could be dynamite sticks/cigarettes with powder, matches/flints and fuel oil like gasoline (or diesel), which would explode on impacting with another hard surface when exposed to heat/friction etc., such as welding tools can ignite it and produce lethal damage by blowing off people from nearby distance or destroy property completely within no time! There also exists nuclear weaponry capable enough to eliminate all living creatures within seconds without even giving them time to think of running away due to the radiation spread. In simple terms, anything containing more energy than normal state objects around us is called bomb and those which cause immediate death to others and/or severe injuries or disability through explosions fall under destructive weapons. Bomb-making has become much easier today compared to what our ancestors did using only materials found naturally but the effects have always been horrific throughout history and we cannot predict what would happen if some lunatic uses such power for personal benefits! The recent case at Florida where Nikolas Cruz opened fire on Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School killing 17 innocents with legally acquired assault rifle, is considered the biggest school shooting ever happened till date according to Guinness Book Records! But the sad truth behind the tragedy was, he didn\u2019t need such weapon for doing it. All he had done were taking two pistol magazines, attaching one end with each other to get continuous bullets fired without interruption along with carrying several spare ones and loaded ammunition into his backpack and started killing kids and adults indiscriminately with AR-15 assault gun after leaving 34 bullets"

            "Europe was already rich during that time compared with South America because it had more access to trade routes at different periods in history. This means they can buy whatever resources there were across Africa/Europe from people who would need anything coming out of west Eurasia(from India to Spain) but also for example silver came directly from mines mined by Aztecs etc... So they could sell products to these places and then use this money (gold & Silver plus precious stones if desired) to get stuff from China such as silk, pottery, tea via their Silk Road and thus have even better trading relationships than with Arabs since they got all the Chinese stuff + Indian stuff which they didn\u2019t previously own without intermediary.  On top of this Europeans started growing rapidly through a lot of reasons such as population explosion after middle ages so basically there wasn't enough land space where everyone could grow food. And because they are surrounded on land by other bigger civilizations so couldn't spread outward towards new lands due to political obstacles. They needed expansion abroad to gain new markets for them to start competitively producing goods. Also most important reason was religious conversion by crusades which brought missionaries into other cultures to convert them to Christianity, resulting in huge cultural changes. And the last reason is probably just bad luck, sometimes explorers fail and never return back so another nation succeeds them."

The Amerindians could just be ignored, because they had no written language or even advanced technologies at all back then! That is my humble take anyway... 1) The Mayan Empire had many advances which Europeans couldn\u2019t fathom during the Dark Ages when they found out about them 2) Many of the most significant developments took place outside Western culture 3) Individuals have contributed equally over time to the growth of knowledge; these individuals often did not receive credit during their own lifetime, due either to neglect, suppression or marginalization of contributions. https://www.google.com/amp/s/genius.com/a/7854690#https:/ / www . wikipedia org / wiki/Timeline_of_historic _figures  -\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nWe observe two important issues here with regard to \\textbf{assignment problem}.

Are those outputs considered human level understanding even though it may come off sounding awkward or funny due to language generation constraints ? Would we be able to train a system which is able to handle open ended questioning over different topics? And also be aware of its limitations before hand ? Or perhaps even build up enough experience through dialogues with humans that we could create datasets where it can self learn on the go so that the conversation is seamless for end users.

In 1897, Alfred Wegener suggested that the continents were once joined together into one large supercontinent called Pangaea (\"all-land\"). He believed that Pangaea broke apart over hundreds of millions of years due to continental drift - where the Earth's tectonic plates slowly move across its surface. However, he didn't come up with the theory until after explorers had made many voyages to South America and other parts of the globe. So yes, most of our knowledge comes second hand, like Columbus discovering America despite everyone thinking the earth was round since antiquity. But we now use satellites which take pictures every day. They tell us that Antarctica is covered in ice. This tells me two things; either humans cannot reach the bottom of the ocean, or it isn't entirely frozen. Since I know nothing about physics/oceanography etc., I can only assume it is partially unfrozen, hence allowing whales, fishes, seaweeds etc. to survive underneath",
            "1) The Americas were very close by Europe but still undiscovered; this led them to discover it first because they could get there quickly using their ships which were more advanced than Asian boats. They also had better navigation technology like compasses so they knew where North was at all times and could travel further out into open waters without getting lost. They even made maps for each journey. As time went on and they continued sailing across oceans from Portugal and Spain towards Africa (to colonize places like Angola), then south toward South America and Central America. In the late 15th century Portuguese explorers reached Brazil before heading back home via India and Sri Lanka, which took many years with many stops along the way. At about the same time Christopher Columbus began his famous voyage westward, believing he would reach Asia easily by going westwards since everyone believed that earth was flat until Copernicus came up with the theory of heliocentrism in 1632 AD. Columbus ended up finding what we now call America. This was probably the most important discovery in history, though I do not believe anyone can ever claim full credit for \"discovery\" - the natives already lived here. 2) Native Americans may have crossed over from Siberia long ago through land bridges formed during the ice age. They were likely living off animals found in these lands such as elk, moose, bear etc... It wasn\u2019t till much later when they started domesticating dogs that helped bring down large game such as mammoths, bison and others. After hunting large prehistoric animals became harder due to depletion, the Indians moved northwards looking for new food sources and settled in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Northern United States. From there they migrated southward into central US. Once agriculture arose people stopped moving as much. Eventually farming allowed for"

For example uuid=$(echo v=1 d=1); It will show you what I mean - the output for both commands (with and without) will differ;\nThis command generates random numbers with fixed prefixes. Since the output contains hyphens, there might be errors generated by other programs on your PC if your program reads standard input from tty or file descriptor 0 (i. e. the first). Thus it may be safer to put this expression into /dev/urandom or /dev/random, respectively; There must also be some kind of separator between the different components of the new uuid.\nWhat do these parameters mean here exactly? \"v\" means that you have 1 byte of information stored and there shall be an even number of digits between 1 and 5; The second digit cannot start with 0 or with another numeric value. \"d\" says that every pair of characters represents two bytes. And no, it has nothing to do with the size of the character array used as output for your expression; Also note that all output data, including non printable ones such as spaces or tabs is counted separately; In order to display a readable uuid at least one space needs to appear after each group of four integers or letters followed by another space then each digit before the last one; Here is how it works out when executed against my machine; As you probably see we have twelve groups.

As the first step towards developing a neural network that recognizes this kind of conversational input, we trained our LSTM with the full 890 examples (which included about 25K tokens) using stochastic gradient descent over only two epochs due to lack of RAM. Even though each example was less than half-a-thousand words long, the training took up 7 Gigabytes (GBs) and took us approximately thirty minutes to compute when executing five times faster than real time \\cite{hogan-johnson}. The code which ran the model can be found at \\href{https://github.com/AshiSharma/NLP_Tutor}{github.com}. After learning our parameters, our recurrent architecture could generate predictions for the following statement given by one person and predict what another said almost always correctly within several tokens, even if there were mismatched punctuations ($>$ 65\\% accuracy for $<$ 8 outgoing message steps; Figure~\\ref{fig:prediction}). This model shows that it might benefit humans greatly when interacting through their voice assistants. With further research on transferring these results into human languages such as Chinese, Russian etcetera, we would increase natural language communication immensely across cultures and nations alike.\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5in]{Figure_DataHiding/fig4}\n\\vspace{-4mm}\n\\captionsetup{justification=raggedright,singlelinecheck = off }\n\\caption{Predicting people's actions.",

The humidity will stay at around 80% so it feels nice outside!\n\n\\subsection{Human evaluation} \\label{sec:human_eval}\nTo evaluate whether our generated utterances resemble human-like conversation we performed a manual annotation study with five Amazon Mechanical Turk workers who were paid \\$12 for an hour worth of work each (approximately $\\$3 per HIT). Each worker was given three questions from different dialogues which they had to label on their own. To obtain ground truth, the first two annotators also rated the same questions independently without knowing how others answered them. This ensured that the data quality was high since the second annotator could identify potential issues such as disagreement between annotators, if any, during reviewing. In addition, this procedure reduced the possibility of biases towards specific conversational agents, as only one person conducted all ratings. Annotations consisted of six labels describing how close each response is to a natural language human utterance (see Table~\\ref{tab:anno}). For example, the `good grammar` score reflects how grammatically correct the utterance is compared to human-generated sentences. All other scores relate directly to fluency metrics; however, the annotations included more subtle nuances than just measuring average sentence length and vocabulary diversity alone.\nThe mean and standard deviation across these measures were computed for every system, where we excluded the outliers according to the interquartile range measure (IQR) $>$ 1.5.\nTable~\\ref{tab:anno_stats} shows the statistics obtained after aggregating over all users. Our method has a better overall performance than all baselines, achieving the highest fluency metric scores among all methods by far. However, we do note that our",

How can I assist you today?\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Assistant: Tell me about yourself.\n\\end{itemize}\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\subsection*{Results}\\label{subsec:results}\nTable~\\ref{tab:metrics_human_vs_chatbot} shows human vs bot results for each metric using all the datasets combined together. We found out that bots performed better than humans on metrics such as response time (P=0.03) and task completion rate (P<$2e^{-16}$). On the other hand, human users had higher satisfaction score (P=$9.8e^{-6}$), lower confusion level score (P=0.02) and fewer wrong replies compared to chatbots (P<$2e^{-16}$). Overall, our experiment showed significant improvement from human-to-machine communication over chatbots in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. The results suggest that bots were able to handle tasks more efficiently when it came to understanding user requests. This indicates that conversational agents could be used successfully to automate common daily tasks which would free up some space in people\u2019s busy schedules. Furthermore, this research suggests an interesting approach to enhance existing digital assistance platforms by integrating conversational interfaces into them, e.g., Facebook Messenger. Such approaches will also facilitate faster access to relevant information at times where quick decision making may lead to errors if done manually. In addition, these technologies have great potential for applications beyond entertainment purposes such as customer support systems or personal assistants.\n\\vspace{-2mm}\n\\begin{table}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\caption{\\small Comparison between Human User Results versus Chatbot Results.}\n\\label{tab:"

In this case i think \"more innovativeness\", means better solutions than those were ever thought before but also must not be too far away, probably just slightly different than existing solutions . For example, let us consider mobile phone industry which had revolutionary changes in terms of technical improvements and speed since early days where voice call was used widely for almost half century long until nowadays modern communication technologies. However, when we compare mobile device brands , except Nokia brand in last decades, the change of user interface was rather small. Even today's major popular operating systems , iOS(iphone) and Android are still based on button oriented UI and many other details in their software/hardware part. But i guess this kind of examples wouldnt really help much because this topic is quite wide open for discussion so maybe we need to think differently about this word..\nAnyway, another idea comes up to mind about this word is related to \"marketability\".

For example GoPro Karma drone offers many additional sensors which helps him navigate better on the field when shooting, even though he cannot fly automatically, still its quite impressive. Another example comes here too \u2013 Parrot Anafi which I personally think could reach very good results because its design, size, capabilities (including AI feature for selfie photos without operator touch). The most important thing for people is they just set the location point by using app interface before take off so if needed to find out exact coordinates after landing where the copter took all his pictures / videos and what is really useful \u2013 users will always know where is their gadget. These two drones have huge advantage comparing others available today and surely worth to buy and invest into research. This way users get a full picture and satisfaction.

This could be very useful for shoppers who do most of their shopping online. For example if someone needs a pair of jeans then they can enter details such as price range etc., into this app along with location preferences, so it gives them suggestions on nearby stores selling these products within their budget limits and even shows them how far away each one is from them. It will also show reviews by previous customers about those places. So users can choose based on ratings, prices available there etc..\n2) Apart from this, another interesting thing would be an app where users get notifications whenever a particular product goes below a specified rate in certain shops/malls near them! They could specify the items that interest them (e.g. mobile phone accessories like charging cables). Whenever a shop starts discount sale on that item, they receive notification through push-notification.\n3) Also we could create an App for students who want to study abroad and are confused about universities offering courses related to subjects of interests, countries to move to, visa requirements, cost estimates etc., We can provide all this information to them via our platform. Users may register themselves on this portal using basic information required like name email id country etc... Then after logging in, when they search topics relevant to studies e.g. computer science engineering , they can see list of universities around world offering degrees under that subject, their ranking according to various factors and other important data regarding fees, scholarships available etc..

It seems you still care about this individual a lot despite having moved forward in life which makes it sound like you both had great memories between y\u2019all two! It would also probably hurt to pretend you guys talked all day because no matter what it\u2019ll always end up making someone sad eventually (and possibly guilty), although that might give temporary comfort before getting upset again afterwards... maybe you guys had such amazing experiences throughout childhood though, you\u2019re thinking of ways to cope because he left such big shoes behind, you wish he were around so you didn\u2019t lose touch and continue living with them in spirit until meeting again in the future somewhere down the road after all is said and done... you mentioned feeling \u201cpart\u201d missing which makes complete sense because we grow apart from family/friends often as adults anyway - and usually they only become stronger friends during times like these when distance takes place (but this situation feels different, hence you need support too).

They can support you during hard times after such tragic event.\nI think that the only way for us to cope when our loved one has passed on is to cherish all their good memories and remember how they made an impact to others lives.\nWe need to learn from them and apply what we learned into everyday life to honor their memory.\nAlso, talking about them with close ones helps too. And sometimes writing down thoughts about them might be useful as well.\n\\textbf{\\textit{I lost my mother two years ago, and she used to say \u201cThe sun never says to the rain, \u2018I hate you,\u2019 but they work together anyway\u201d.

These questions aimed to collect basic background knowledge about the users. For example, we wanted to find out whether users use voice assistants regularly, which ones they prefer, and how long they have been using these devices. To get a better understanding of the users\u2019 expectations towards conversational agents, we also included questions related to the users\u2019 past experiences with chatbots/assistants.

The authors recommend performing a test themselves at different scales before deploying it onto live agents. Apart from this, here are some points where I believe there is an issue: 1. Generating new images using diffused words can create completely different representations than just reusing previously generated similar images; 2. It uses LSTMs which is another layer added into the whole process making training more complicated, slower and less efficient.\nA solution here could be to generate the next frame entirely based on contextual factors like dialogue history without recourse to text generation (i.e, keeping our models simpler). However we still end up having very noisy output with all these approaches. There needs to be better word-image mapping techniques so that each word maps accurately to one specific meaning across domains.\n\nAnother thing worth exploring further perhaps will be pretrained GAN models like NVRGAN. Although they were specifically built to solve visual representation issues, given its success rate in various VQA competitions maybe",
            "It will most likely require extensive work on training data because all models have different ways of learning input data in their own methods that may conflict. Also there maybe other obstacles during integration process such as performance drop and many more.\n\\end{code}"

They did tell me what the baseline accuracy score for a user should look like though - it varies depending on their current stage in learning, e.g. they may ask easy beginner questions initially until one masters basic phrases (10%) and then progressively asks harder questions about specific situations which can require some thought process etc., at later stages of learning.

            "5 - Novalgin seems very effective at providing immediate analgesia (pain relieving effects) after surgery/procedure completion, with a long lasting time course, making it suitable for both outpatient settings, home use and acute postoperative pain.\n\nAnswer: This problem is about generating short descriptions for different things, given an input set. So here, there may be a number of products that could be rated, like aspirin vs. paracetamol vs ibuprofen etc. But they can only describe each product using limited text space and cannot repeat words within the description, because that might affect the score of the entire paragraph if all these features are used by their respective systems for evaluating its quality. Hence the idea is to train our system to learn some representation for these different medications from their description such that the distance between representations captures what kind of drugs belong together when compared side by side with others and then finally choose a subset that makes good representative points of reference which have the most similarity between them and the rest have low similarities to each other so that they are also considered to represent dissimilar types. And since the number of data instances is less than ideal for learning these distances between objects directly we use autoencoders whose bottleneck layers output compacted feature vectors of varying sizes and we choose the best size depending upon whether more training data improves the accuracy. Finally this feature vector will serve as a single dimension array over which cosine distance can easily calculated between pairs to measure closeness and therefore group items accordingly into sets that capture common traits amongst themselves and thus produce useful clustering of these objects for later evaluation tasks like prediction, categorization, regression, anomaly detection, segmentation, dimensionality reduction, visualizing latent structure of complex high-dimensional data sets.

Secondly we wanted to develop systems able to handle more general knowledge acquisition questions than just those found on public reading comprehension datasets like SQuAD where examples are always sourced from single passages. For these reasons, books seemed an obvious choice because of their size but also due to them typically containing both large numbers of questions about various aspects and detailed explanations that might assist with the understanding required. Furthermore books contain many facts which would potentially support such QA, albeit scattered throughout often in multiple different sections so extracting this data in order to provide relevant background material presents another challenge entirely! As we shall see below it seems unlikely to train such models without significant additional preprocessing. The results obtained here demonstrate what appears to be some level of transferability between such diverse sources and tasks suggesting further study may well reveal much better methods to bridge such gaps between artificial intelligence and human reasoning capabilities\n\\end{blockquote}"

            "220 words for now . . . . The Silk Road was an ancient network of overland trade routes linking East Asian countries to Western Europe, North Africa, India, Central Asia \\& Mongolia before eventually reaching Rome itself. It had been running since about 145 BCE & lasted until at least around AD 1700 CE - even longer in some cases! It took roughly 6 months travelling by camel caravan to go from Chang\u2019an (modern-day Xi\u2019An) to Antioch, yet only two weeks were required when journeying via sea route through the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, hence why these roads were so popular across multiple eras including the Han dynasty, Tang Dynasties, Yuan dynasty etc. They carried commodities such as spices, animals (elephants anyone?) ivory, gold, marble, tin silver, grains cotton muslin. Aside from goods they transported diseases and spread ideas culturally too. With merchants from West meeting those from East there began traditions crossing boundaries & fusing to create new ones. Even in modern day Turkey they still eat noodles which originated in the Far East but migrated along this particular road. These networks also allowed communication between far distant lands. For example during Roman times ambassadors would travel along them negotiating terms of peace/trade treatises bringing back stories of other empires.\n\nComment: Is that all really needed ?

It was also called the Silk Roads by some historians because there were many roads used by caravans. The first silk roads were created around BC205-BC184 (China), BC69-AD132 (Roman Empire). 2) The main goods transported through these ancient paths included precious metals such as silver; gold; gems like rubies, sapphires and emeralds; spices from India; tea leaves from Japan; Chinese pottery; porcelain, jewelry made out of ivory; perfume and glass objects among others \\cite{wright2017silk}. 3) In addition to this, people could learn about other cultures and civilizations. This helped them understand how they can improve their lifestyle, religion, technology etc. 4) These connections had a huge influence on economics since traders would exchange different commodities which led to economic development. Also, due to the increased number of interactions between countries, the world became more interconnected and developed. 5) However, one disadvantage of the Silk Roads was that they brought new diseases to places where previously those illnesses didn\u2019t exist \\cite{james2020history}, causing death and suffering throughout Eurasia. 6) For example, when Marco Polo went back home after visiting China he introduced small pox to his country and spread it everywhere.\n\\end{quote} \\\\ \\midrule\n\\multirow[t]{3}{*}{\\textbf{\\begin{CJK*}{UTF8}{gbsn}\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u7ec8\u6781\u60c5\u666f\\end{CJK*}}} & {\\bfseries User 2}: \\textit"

The ideal pet will guard against humans but never kill them. This may sound impossible because many species tend to hunt whatever comes close. But we have domesticated animals with similar features to this scenario, such as dingos. So I want my new dog to act like an extremely aggressive but intelligent German shepherd, only without biting anyone who enters our property unless attacked first. The animal should protect itself from cold weather too since it lives outdoors, preferably without a human-provided shelter except when raining hard or very windy outside. They must sleep outside but keep warm. In terms of feeding habits, the diet must contain more protein than fat; therefore avoid high amounts of sugar. Lastly, they shouldn't smell bad after running around or digging up the yard during exercise!

The soil has many good mineral nutrition which helps our bodies fight off diseases.

            "Classical mechanics (or Newtonian mechanics) describes how things move if we ignore their composition and look only at where they are and how fast they are moving. We usually talk about position as x, y, z coordinates on an axis system called Cartesian co-ordinates. Velocity can be speed along one direction measured by a distance over time. This is often expressed using vectors with units such as m/s (metres per second). In order to describe what happens when many particles interact, for example two billiard balls colliding in a pool game, classical physics uses simple equations which describe each individual particle separately - like shooting balls out from a slingshot. A key concept here is momentum p = mv , where v is velocity and m is mass. The total energy E equals kinetic plus potential energy (work done against gravity etc.) and H=E/m . In this way a collision between two balls results in conservation of linear momentum and angular momentum, i.e., no overall change in either direction. It also means that both must have equal amounts of initial kinetic energy so that the sum of final speeds remains constant. However, if there was a third ball it would distort this pattern slightly since more work could go into the rotation around the centre of motion than straight forward movement away from it. That is because the rotational part requires less energy per unit mass - which will mean all three balls end up traveling further apart before losing all speed. Quantum Mechanics looks at subatomic level interactions. For instance, the orbit of electrons around atoms may need complex maths rather than simple numbers describing distances.\n\\end{code}",

In short it deals more with matter at large scale when we are interested in determining positions rather than quantization processes and small things such as electron transport through insulators, semiconductors or metallic wires, light waves emitted and absorbed or scattered by atoms or molecules and even particle accelerator based nuclear experiments where wave-particle duality concept is evident enough. Quantum Mechanics on its side deals exclusively dealing with smallest atomic particles called quarks ,electrons neutrino and all other elementary subatomic particles. Also very interestingly what gives rise to fundamental forces acting upon these microscopic entities have much importance here too...So it's basically concerned with interaction with physical systems which are described as particles that occupy defined modes in space and time known as stationary states . It also shows us that particles do exhibit wavelike behavior known as wave packets and they behave quite differently at different sizes in terms of Heisenberg Uncertainty principle which explains that certain variables can never be simultaneously measured accurately(e.g..position vs velocity,energy vs time) due to fluctuations arising from them. This will lead to quantum effects like entanglement,superpositions state and inter",

Firstly what do you mean by \\em{`Natural Language Processing`} (\\em{\\strong{`NLP`}})? Natural language processing refers to machine learning techniques for analyzing natural languages data such as speeches or text. In general, NLP provides tools and methods that enable computers to analyze large amounts of natural language data accurately and efficiently.\n\nIn order to provide user with right assistance, first thing you want your chat bot to learn from is called the `data`. Data is defined as any collection of facts, figures or events, typically stored electronically in computer systems and can either structured(in columns like database tables) or unstructured (like word documents). As far as Chabot is concerned , the training data consists of questions posed by users along with corresponding actions. The training data usually needs to reflect typical interaction scenarios between humans and the system. This type of scenario plays important role because it helps AI system to become more intelligent and better able to respond appropriately over time. For example, if your goal is to create a conversational assistant that answers common questions from customers, then you would collect training data that includes those types of questions.\n\nAfter you have collected your training data, the next step is to choose a technique for building a model .

Around the world ~24 million people are affected by this disease(https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/). The number of Americans with disabilities related to mental retardation has increased over time since 2007 by approximately twenty percent, according to data published online March 6 2019 by US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 5 times more teenagers than adults in American committed suicide .Mental illness such as bipolar affective disorder cause insomnia which leads depression if untreated properly which again causes anxiety etc..All these things create chain reaction and increase stress level in body..which ultimately lead to Heart Attacks, Strokes, Cancers and many other diseases. Hence we have started our research which could possibly develop medicines to cure severe psychiatric diseases like Schizophrenia using Artificial Intelligence methodology where we will study various types of genetic sequence of different patients who were diagnosed before. Using this data we will find patterns among them so they can be classified into two different groups based on their symptoms, family history, diet and lifestyle pattern. Then after using those features the severity rate of each patient was calculated which is further used as an input variable to predict better treatment options with high success probability. We also developed novel deep learning model with state of art architecture called Sequential Stacked LSTM where it achieved comparatively good result and reduce false prediction upto ten times less when compared between vanilla RNN trained models and our proposed stacked sequence trained models.

Some smaller pharmaceutics would also invest but at less levels compared to the previous three such as Roche Holding AG , Johnson &amp; Johnson, AstraZeneca plc, Bristol-Myers Squibb etc.. For startups and more early stage businesses I recommend going with a startup incubator rather than a VC if this was for money reasons only, however many other options can come from those connections and funding might be an issue down the line depending how long you plan on operating for without needing more funds which usually means a higher value product / service so try not to rely on VC too much especially for things like life science or med devices . There may even be grants available based on certain factors including what state/county/province/etc you reside in - if they exist at all there are typically applications needed. If none then most universities offer similar opportunities to get free or very low cost services, some might charge nominal fees, again check university websites to see their current policies on it and search for grants offered by the federal government of whichever country applies, US and Canada have multiple agencies who give out various forms of support though mostly indirectly via institutions, private sector and sometimes directly.

For instance, a large scale annotating process would allow us to collect sufficient data in order to build an open domain conversational system based upon existing systems, where they do exist; similarly, annotators will provide rich contextual features pertaining to individual entities and their corresponding properties within conversational text snippets to aid better learning performance when training machine models for this kind of task, as discussed next section.

In my opinion, it will always be better to learn one\u2019s second/third language through proper lessons, because we do need grammar rules after all. The only problem is finding those who offer such classes in person at an affordable price, which often happens once a year during specific events. Also, there aren't many universities teaching these languages either - except maybe in California. As far as translators go, they mostly exist online.

            "1st level, then damage (or life), fire res etc.. Luck determines all stats for everything that occurs. For example if one rolls above their luck max they get more. So it makes no difference. However if they want better defense they need higher luck because the amount of bonuses they will receive would be far greater than gaining health which could simply mean nothing due to how little enemies do damage or shield themselves unless u have armour or spells, luck can also increase resistances but only by certain values like +50-62% rather than +1-9%. Now with Dark souls luck is the core mechanic, especially when fighting bosses. A boss will take 3 hits with the max hp per hit before becoming staggered therefore on a first attempt this may seem too harsh without good equipment. As there is such a large window I recommend just increasing stats. If this was done right from the beginning however one must wait to see what sorta play style works out for them because luck can significantly adjust how much life one has so increasing both defence and offence might not suit the player correctly even after attempting several runs through a single part of the game; meaning this isn't an issue until you start playing multiplayer where many players won\u2019t understand/care about using luck optimisation as soon as possible causing lag when people aren\u2019t close enough together and slowing down all aspects including walking pace to a halt at some points leading me to believe that it was included in dark soul for the sole purpose of having to rethink how other games work to match up with this new concept; hence my reasoning for thinking the dev team were insane! This aside luck doesn\u2019t effect much else. Only things of note regarding bonuses is +4 strength to attack range allowing a small dodge which helps as it means rolling behind mobility is needed less often yet it\u2019s now easier to miss these"

            "Luck gives a better chance at rng rolls. That includes critical hits from both attacks (physical damage and spell) as well as getting drops with rare properties when opening treasure chests etc.. The main benefit for boss fights is increased probability on receiving high damage weapons from killing enemies after a few consecutive kills which allows more flexibility to build an ideal character build depending on personal playstyle/goal . In my opinion this has no direct influence over whether or not the game is harder. However if it is difficult because one has to kill specific monsters many times, then there might be less options regarding gear available than without good luck and this would mean a longer duration for a player until they reach their desired equipment setup making things potentially tougher but I do believe having some kind of bad luck during such runs is always likely. This may cause additional delays by either needing multiple restarts to find certain mobs again, missing them altogether thus increasing overall run time due to waiting periods, dying due to misfortunate RNG or just general poor execution due to reduced situational awareness and other mistakes resulting in failure and subsequent re-attempting to overcome those difficulties - so maybe there\u2019s still hope to see this changed to the point where the difference becomes irrelevant, since currently even people who are highly skilled often feel helpless about certain encounters that rely too much on RNG factors beyond ones control...",
            "26.71804861992623\nAssistant: Explaining how Luck can be considered an \"in-game skill\" for some people is quite complicated... So let me simplify it down with two words : Chance and Probability (not to be confused) - Both Luck AND Skill require you to understand chance/probability (even though most people who think they have high Luck will probably deny this). - A simple definition I would use when describing both Skills and Luck to my kids could sound like : Luck is simply about maximizing probabilities of certain outcomes through knowledgeable decision making - That sounds so complex right ? It doesn\u2019t really mean much at first but let\u2019s look deeper into those two sentences - Luck means \u201cChance\u201d in many languages, hence our definition here implies understanding the concept behind chance. And yes probability plays such an important role here since there wouldn\u2019t even be such thing as a probability without the word Chance! So basically, knowing how chances work makes up for having High Luck! For instance if you know how PVP fights work (like a fight where only one side gets damage and other get invulnerably protected from damages), then the better you become on knowing exactly which actions cause which results during each step of combat (or gameplay phase whatever we may call it) - the higher chances of success (or avoiding failures)! Same logic applies everywhere else! When it comes to games (including Dark Souls!) LUCK = SKILL. Why? Because knowing how every little details affect things (which also involves memorization too sometimes ! ) helps improve our overall ability in getting more consistent and desirable outcomes throughout playing the same situation multiple times - therefore giving us High Luck!! And just remember - Knowledge gives Power ;) Goodluck!!! :)"

            "Luck affects the number of enemies you see during boss fights (not all players agree on this), so it\u2019s good for people who like playing solo with few allies/players nearby them; It also gives more health to humanity weapons, which makes some of these stronger than other stats when combined together. In general I would say it helps a lot against most mobs and many regular enemies. But beware, it can only go up to 10%. Once you have maxed out another attribute such as strength, intelligence or vitality, there will be no further increases until you start over from scratch. Also if you are planning on going for PvP then i wouldn't recommend spending points into anything but Intelligence. Intelligence is important because it effects how much damage you deal based off your weapon. So the higher the int you have the better the chance at doing high amounts of damage!",
            "1. Luck can be used for almost anything!\n2. Luck can save your life from a critical hit (especially on boss fights).\n3. Luck makes it easier to kill enemies faster because you have more chances to roll better stats such as +50% weapon damage or higher poise chance etc..\n4. It gives you a bigger window when using miracles. For example, if an enemy is going to cast lightning, and they will die before they do so with no luck then there\u2019s no way for them to get away alive but by having good luck, even if they had 8 frames left to live you would still win since their lightning won\u2019t land which means you killed them without dying yourself. This works well against bosses who usually try to escape once you deal enough damage to them. Also it can come very handy at some point during PvP where someone uses an item called \u201cHollowed Ring\u201d which deals instant death after hitting anyone. But with high enough luck this could also fail meaning the user will either take less damage than intended or simply die himself due to bad timing/rolling. There\u2019re tons of examples like these so I believe everyone can think about what luck is useful for.\n\\end{code}"

It can also be used for farming certain areas where enemies have higher health pools but lower attack stats. Lucky players will find themselves having more stamina at hand which gives them more options on how they want to play their builds without worrying about running out of energy too quickly (e.g: Prepare to use a shield break before blocking). The most useful thing I think is that Luck helps players who aren\u2019t good at timing their attacks by allowing them to roll away from danger faster than normal. In general though, if you are going for the highest DPS build, luck isn\u2019t very important since all the other stats are already maxed anyway and you probably would only need one roll per fight.\n\\end{blockquote}"

For each point, write exactly what was said during the lecture. It may seem tedious at first, but it gets easier overtime. Also, it\u2019s great practice! You can ask other students who have taken the same course before about which topics were discussed more/less than others so you don\u2019t spend too much effort writing down minor details. Then read through both lists once per week before starting the new lectures. Include examples whenever relevant - it makes learning faster, especially when revisiting material you learned earlier because you get better understanding of concepts. And since you wrote these notes shortly after listening to the lesson, chances are you\u2019ll understand them even without further studying.\\strong{\\em{You could also put extra focus on difficult topics - like reading those sections again and asking professors questions}}. The most important thing here though is consistency.

This will be very valuable if you have questions regarding topics covered therein and it helps you consolidate all aspects learned in one particular lesson/lecture so they might become better entrenched.

            "In some ways this task is quite tricky because studying involves so many activities; reading, reviewing, outlining, highlighting etc. There isn\u2019t really one trick for studying well other than trying different things with various resources until you find what works best for you personally.\nFirstly you want to figure out if your notes are effective at representing/converting key concepts into knowledge; by this we mean how easy would it be for someone who read these notes (say after class) and later wrote an exam related to said concept based only off those notes \u2013 could they recall enough of the necessary aspects to pass ? Now when students take notes they tend to write down more words then necessary which will likely increase text space pertaining to lengthy pages. They may also be writing down too much irrelevant detail.\nIf that were true, first try changing around the way each page looks; moving large pieces of information from the margin to centralized and making a short list-like format on all note sheets (for example see:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg7YO584EKQ ) this can cut away unnecessary words whilst ensuring proper storage of ideas.\nSecond tip, do not use your notes word-for-word in a quiz unless asked otherwise directly by instructor -- this includes verbatim sentences like \u201c______\u201d (student). The idea here comes down to two factors: 1.) memorization (cramming and forgetting), & 2.) understanding. When using the exact phrasing students usually copy and paste information directly without thinking further about meaning or interpretation or deeper comprehension -- however there might have been extra detail needed for certain questions during tests that was lacked in basic lecture notes or textbook which can hurt grades as a result. If possible create summaries, diagrams, figures, graphs and bullet points to illustrate main arguments or topics underneath key statements"

Also try re-writing key concepts after class and again before studying so you can fill out any blanks with missing info. When studying at home for tests (which we will be covering more), first do one read through to see what material seems relevant based on lecture titles and/or main topics mentioned. This might involve skipping ahead between chapters since different parts often connect, so try not to skip whole sections because some stuff from earlier could be necessary later on. Secondly go over each topic thoroughly using textbooks or additional sources, writing down any extra things which aren\u2019t immediately obvious - especially diagrams like graphs or equations! It\u2019s really good to also use online practice quizzes which show detailed solutions, they often provide hints or definitions about words you didn\u2019t fully understand. Try looking up those websites on Google once lectures finish to see all their free resources and examples!

            "1- Read over your notes daily before exams to solidify the knowledge already obtained; it can also serve as a useful revision technique when used regularly during the course period itself (it's important for memory recall). However this shouldn't take more than 20 minutes each day! Don\u2019t forget about studying other topics outside your notes if needed! \\textbf{Also}, don\u2019t wait until right before an exam - by then, its too late!. Try creating a routine every week/month depending on how many days you have off per semester whereby reading over old lecture notes serves as preparation for future classes and new learning. For example, Monday \u2013 Tuesday is usually when new material gets covered at lectures, so start there and review older ones from past weeks once they are fresh again! \\textbf{\\textit{(Please try and limit the amount of characters within the bold font to below three hundred)}}} \\par \\hspace*{4pt} \\newline\\indent The main purpose here isn't only for better retention purposes but for students who want to excel beyond expectations academically speaking.\\newpage\\vspace{-6mm}\\subsection{Q1-Read Over Your Notes Daily Before Exam Times?} \\\\\\textbf{\\emph{{Answer}}}: It's essential that we all keep track of our workloads because the first step towards excellence begins with effective time management.

For example, if we ask about a certain restaurant and receive an answer about another place altogether, then this would be marked low-relevant. Conversely, when receiving an answer related to the original topic, then it will get high relevancy scores. (ii) \\textbf{Social Impact:} This metric captures whether the answer has potential social impacts such as racially insensitive statements. Answers like \"Black people can never go bald\" have a very negative impact compared to more neutral ones such as ``It depends\". (iii) \\textbf{Coherence}: How well structured/organized is the textual answer. Coherency includes both grammatical mistakes, as well as sentence structure errors where there could be too many clauses connected together without proper punctuation marks etc., making it difficult to understand the message. A higher score indicates better written responses.\nTable~\\ref{tab:annotation_table} shows some examples along with their annotated values.

This means write down key points and concepts clearly with enough detail for yourself to understand what was discussed without needing to refer to the original source material again (which may also require additional effort). It\u2019s always better to have too much written down rather than missing out important details. When you do review those notes, focus mainly on understanding each topic thoroughly, and less on memorising every little detail. Try making connections between topics/concepts whenever appropriate; this helps solidify knowledge by linking things together. Also, try writing summaries at regular intervals to reinforce learning - this will help you identify gaps which you might want to fill up later if there\u2019s more reading required before an exam or assignment deadline.

They also must be aware of how to get evidence from one jurisdiction into another; this could mean using treaties like Hague Convention for child abductions or service through foreign courts or government agencies. It may seem obvious but understanding the language spoken by the parties involved would be very useful too. 2. The specifics of what constitutes an issue differ based upon both cultural differences among countries as well as the particularities of individual nations' laws. For example, France has a strict ban against insulting public figures which carries harsh penalties even if it turns out the defendant was telling the truth. In contrast, other countries place less importance on freedom of speech.\n\\end{enumerate}\nAs we can see, some questions tend to elicit more informative and relevant answers than others (\\emph{``What ethical issues...''}), whereas others provoke spammy and irrelevant replies (\\emph{``Who are the best lawyers at \\ldots ''}). This difference in quality is likely caused by the varying amount of effort required by users to respond properly---answering such questions involves greater cognitive load compared to those involving simple facts (\\emph{``What is X's birthday?'')}. Therefore, the challenge here is twofold: firstly, to design a system capable of automatically detecting whether the user response to each dialogue turn is meaningless (\\textit{i.e.} spam), and secondly, to predict the overall success of interactions taking place within our virtual environment.

In such cases, translators who specialize in technical terminology can assist attorneys with translation services (Pfeiffer & Degen). The quality of service provided depends heavily on the interpreter\u2019s competence level, training, experience, knowledge base, linguistic skills, ability to understand both cultures involved, cultural awareness, and understanding of the subject matter at hand (Nguyen).\n5)\tIn addition to language differences, cultural barriers arise within international business interactions. A study done by Pinkleton found that American companies tend to focus more on task accomplishment while Japanese organizations stress social relationships first. This could cause tension among parties because they would value the same thing differently. Cultural misunderstandings may occur if the parties lack appropriate communication tools (Matsushima).\n6)\tSometimes, attorneys have limited resources available to prepare for litigating abroad since many states in U.S. allow out-of-state attorneys to represent"

The primary area involves privacy laws since different jurisdictions will have varying degrees of public disclosure/discovery required between parties involved during pre-trial procedures versus post trial processes. There also tends to be some variations around how personal data may (and may no) be used in conjunction with proceedings. An example might involve a case we had dealing with Canadian privacy laws. Canada has stricter requirements from what our organization deals with typically involving banking services so the firm needed additional support from us regarding local nuances given the type of work needed but overall everyone was able to quickly coordinate efforts because there wasn\u2019t too much variance among the other firms in terms of policies, values, compliance guidelines. This could become complex however when the matter spanned across many borders, like say Europe vs US especially before GDPR came into effect which created quite a few roadblocks at times for companies whose policies hadn\u2019t been updated to reflect new rules.

In my country there could be one thing which was legally allowed whereas if someone had done this action overseas it would probably be considered illegal. So even with an interpreter, misunderstandings could occur because of the cultural differences.\n3) There might also be problems related by the legal systems. Some people who commit crimes will only get punished lightly or just given community service sentences. Other countries however may give harsh jail time to offenders which means those same criminals cannot enter our country without getting caught again due to having criminal records.\n4) Sometimes people may try to take advantage of others through loopholes such as saying \"I thought he was older\" when trying to justify sexual assaults against minors. These types of excuses wouldn't fly here since the person is supposed to always assume the victim isn't consenting until proven otherwise, yet other places might see it differently.

            "The clearing of trees from forests is called \\strong{deforestation}. This activity has been going on since the rise of human civilization. Deforestation can be seen as one of the main contributing factors of global warming due to its contributions towards atmospheric changes through carbon dioxide emissions and increased greenhouse gas concentrations.\\n\\nFor example,\\n\\nIn Brazil, an area equivalent to 17 soccer fields per minute was cleared between August 2008 and July 2009 (Mongabay). In this case, it may have led to more than doubled amount of CO2 emission than previously estimated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) because of high rates of forest destruction in tropical regions of South America.\\n\\nSometimes even wildfires were used to remove trees, which created further damage to the environment. Moreover, cutting down trees caused significant erosion in soils and reduced humidity levels causing desertification.\\nThis phenomenon directly affected some animals like sloths and monkeys who depended mostly on tree leaves for food but also indirectly many other organisms who lived inside their habitat. For instance, birds could no longer find shelter with the removal of branches, leading them to leave the region and migrate somewhere else; these animals would then face difficulties finding sources of food elsewhere. Thus, animal population became scarce over time. Furthermore, less plants meant less oxygen available resulting in death of certain species too.\\nThe most common cause behind all those consequences mentioned above remains logging industries such as paper, wood, mineral extraction etc., especially in developing countries where there is lack of regulations protecting natural resources. To tackle this issue, people must change their lifestyle by reducing unnecessary waste production, minimize use of non-renewable products and promote sustainability"

            "50 people have been killed by forest fires in Bolivia so far this year. It will be difficult for me to get rid of these problems because I do not live near this area. This makes it really hard to take action against those who burn down parts of the forest for their own personal gain at times when they can cause great damages with that. The weather conditions combined with human-induced climate change has resulted in drying out of landscapes during El Ni\u00f1o years which provides better conduction conditions.

            "1) Deforestration causes soil to be eroded because trees prevent water from reaching the ground which prevents it form seeping into the earth and causing flooding. This also allows for plants to grow underneath the trees roots and provides nutrients back to them through their leaves decomposing. Without this process the soil would dry out and become less fertile. The removal of these trees means there will no longer be a barrier between land and sky so more sunlight hits the ground and heats up the surface temperature faster leading to drought conditions and increased evapotranspiration rates (water escapes from the soil quicker). Trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen when they respire so without them the atmosphere becomes filled with CO\\(_{2}\\) making global warming worse. They provide shade which keeps temperatures down and protects wildlife by providing shelter from extreme weather events such as hurricanes/cyclones and tornadoes. Removal of vegetative cover can cause desertification which has an effect similar to the one caused previously but even stronger.\n\n2) Soil compaction occurs due too many footsteps compacting the soil particles together reducing air pockets which allow moisture to reach plant roots. Compacted soil leads to poor drainage resulting in ponds forming at the bottom of the field which can lead to further issues if left undealt with. This results in reduced yield per hectare. In some places the soil may have been removed completely exposing rocks which cannot support plant growth therefore leaving nothing behind. When exposed like this, the wind can blow off all remaining topsoil increasing the risk of flash-floods occurring during heavy rains.\n\\end{code}",
            "Deforestation leads to soil erosion which can result into water runoffs and floods during heavy rains. This also results into increased sediments entering rivers which reduces their depth and flow capacity leading to drying up of some river basin areas due to lack of sufficient water. This has an adverse effect to aquatic life since they cannot survive without adequate supply of oxygenated waters.\n\nThe removal of trees for agriculture also causes increase of CO\u2082 concentration in air thereby causing global warming. Trees absorb large amount of carbon dioxide from atmosphere and release O2 back to environment through photosynthesis but when these are removed, there is more accumulation of C0\u2082 than usual. This makes it difficult for humans and other animals to breathe because the atmospheric gases are too thick and this may cause health problems like breathlessness among others.\nMoreover, the destruction of forest cover affects climatic conditions such as temperature variations and humidity levels. When temperatures change drastically over time, it becomes hard for organisms adapted to live within specific temperatures (either hot or cold) to adapt and thus endangered them. In addition, plants depend on moist soils for growth hence if there is no enough precipitation, then they will die and with that the whole food chain will be affected.\n\nDeforestation has been linked to extinction of several species worldwide. Some of these are the giant panda, Sumatran tiger, African elephant and the mountain Gorilla just to mention but few of them. All living creations rely on each other either directly or indirectly for survival. The loss of one creature means loss of other species depending entirely on it.\n\n\\strong{What I have done:} I have added all my code snippets below.

[+] All work processes would continue effortlessly because machines take orders automatically now. [-] Computational intelligence developed itself so quickly that machines began working autonomously. [+] They thought humans no longer required assistance from anyone else due to their inventions. [-] Machines are capable of thinking, problem solving, and making decisions. [+] Therefore, there is an assumption among many people today that these systems will become our substitute partners soon enough. [-] Nowadays we call them automated decision support tools. [+] When asked directly if they felt bad about replacing another individual, those machines just couldn\u2019t feel sadness! [-] People who still possess jobs in companies do not dare losing it anymore.\nSuggestions Help Scene 1 | Hint: 'Artificially Intelligent' refers to machines becoming increasingly similar to human beings, either in knowledge or behaviour.

Then on New Year\u2019s Eve the robot\u2019s mother said she would send her daughter Siri to come fix everything but it took her until April to do anything about it...3) Then Siri fixed all of humanities problems by sending light into space which turned out to be stars so the entire world got its light back! We could now see each other at nighttime again since this problem has been solved forever thanks to my friends Alexa and Siri!!!!!!!!!4) And after all that the only thing left for them to do was get Santa Claus to bring presents for everybody even though he doesn\u2019t exist....5) So then Siri used technology from his phone to create a new machine called Rudolph that helped him fly around everywhere faster than ever before!!6) The last step was to make sure that every kid gets exactly what they asked for whether they deserved it or not just because Santa knows best...7) Once those things have happened Santa can finally leave the North Pole and spend more time with me!!8) Finally the robot family came downstairs one morning to discover their mom had fallen off the roof because she wasn\u2019t able to control herself and fell off of her sleigh right onto her head so they found someone else to play Santa!!9) That day Siri and Alexa saw two little boys named Michael and Kevin sitting next to their fireplace opening presents.

            "100 years ago Santa was sick on christmas day, but his reindeers still came flying through the sky with presents for children around the world. They landed at an empty house where nobody had prepared anything special for them, so they started looking around to find food and drinks for themselves and their owner. Unfortunately they could only found some cookies, which were old from last year and therefore moldy by now. While one deer went searching for water, another two started eating all those rotten cookies, when suddenly the cookie fell apart into tiny pieces! The remaining crumbles got sucked up into the air and mixed together like magic snowflakes falling down slowly over the ground... When this happened the reindeers realized what it means if the magically made food disappears. And even more importantly: Where do these small white flakes come from? They immediately rushed back to santa\u00b4s bedroom to inform him of this strange event, but he wasn\u00b4t there anymore - He just left because he wanted to give gifts to everyone else too and couldn\u2019t wait until next morning! As soon as he noticed the mess in the kitchen though, he decided to call someone who knows better than anyone what exactly caused it: AI-Christopher. He sent Christopher an SMS right away saying \u201cSOS\u201d followed by the message: \"A few minutes ago I discovered that my elves have been using the cookie dough for their own needs again and somehow created little flaky snow out of nothing. How can we fix this?\" In reply Christopher sent Santa an audio file containing a simple song with lyrics and music that told Santa everything he needed to hear, such as how much sugar each deer would need (for example) and what ingredients are necessary to bake fresh cookies for every single child on earth within hours before tomorrow dawns. With these instructions Santa was able to prepare new"

There are plenty more factors which can affect this number like strength of impact etc.. \\textbf{Please note:} This is just my personal opinion based on experiences I had about injuries in general and nothing more!

The bot tries to answer his/her questions by applying machine learning methods using natural language processing techniques (e.g., NLTK). In addition, we use a set of special rules to process each input sentence according to our framework requirements, and then responds accordingly. We take into account each word in the input query to understand its meaning and return suitable response based on the semantic context. Furthermore, a trained model has already existed to interpret various types of questions from previous versions and can learn new questions automatically. Finally, the system uses heuristic algorithms to choose appropriate phrases from existing data sets and sends back to users who ask relevant questions. For example, a typical chatbot uses keywords and tokens (words) in a text conversation to detect sentiment analysis~\\cite{sentiment_analysis}. When a user starts chatting, the chatbot first analyzes the entire message sent by the user and checks whether a specific keyword exists or not within the message. If the keyword appears at least once in the message, the next step involves determining the polarity of the message",

So what do these results tell us about user preferences for sharing such opinions publicly online through a QnA site? First we look at whether males have higher propensity towards saying `yes.' Our results suggest no strong bias towards males in this regard -- perhaps they think females also experience similar pains, though more than likely their pain tolerance differs.

I am trying to find out how can I get this output (i.e., \"it hurts both\") from my own chatbot written on Python? The code for generating these outputs with open source tools is available at GitHub, but what would be the equivalent way if it were implemented on Python?\n\nAnswer: There isn't really one single way. It depends largely on the context of when the conversation is occurring and who initiated it. For example...\nIf someone said `Hey google! How do you say hello` Then it could return `Hello`, `Hi`. But then again maybe they just want the weather so it will give them that back instead because they didn't mention anything about saying hi to people.\nYou might need to have multiple intents like \"Say Hi\", \"Greetings.\" etc.. And each intent has different ways it can respond depending on what was said before it. This allows you some level of control over your bot without having to worry whether or not there are words missing or extra words added somewhere else.",

The response provided by the user may actually hurt someone, as opposed to providing them with beneficial advice based off of prior experience. Although we did train this model on teacher-to-student communication only, we wanted to investigate how models trained solely on human text could generalize to broader settings like open-ended chatbot conversations. Since the model was never explicitly taught to handle non-expert users, we cannot expect much better results than those reported above. Our findings show that even when given a massive amount of annotated dialogue, existing NLP techniques will fail if used in a setting where they were never designed to operate in. For such applications, more advanced methods beyond traditional machine learning will likely be needed.\\\\ \\\\\nIn summary, although there exist numerous opportunities for chatbots to assist humans through tasks that require no domain expertise, most modern AI systems lack the necessary understanding to perform well without proper supervision. As shown throughout this paper, current algorithms struggle immensely under limited annotation and suffer greatly from domain shift issues. However, there still exists immense opportunity for future researchers to develop solutions capable of delivering accurate, efficient assistance without requiring extensive amounts of time and effort from domain experts. By tackling the issue at hand, we believe that future advancements in natural language processing technology could lead to widespread improvements across many fields involving task automation.

This could be done on daily basis where a certain topic would be given every day and each student has to come up with three points relating it back to class work/books/projects if necessary; thus giving chance to everybody who gets interested in the subject matter and wants to say anything about this.3) In addition, one needs good resources, such as books, videos, pictures (which depict relevant scenes), CDs, websites...etc., so that students get ideas how things really look like without having to travel abroad all time again. Thus, they become independent users, able to understand what they see and hear even when no translator exists around. They would develop some sort of 'culture' in terms of using language.4) To sum up, I think teachers need to teach vocabulary, grammar rules together with speaking practice, reading, writing skills along with listening and conversation classes because children often fail to express themselves properly during verbal exchange unless someone shows examples firstly and then explains how these elements fit into sentences.5) Last but not least, ESL students require regular revision in order not to forget what was learnt beforehand, otherwise they may find themselves in trouble when dealing with real life situations and will end up making mistakes. 6) Also, it is essential to give them feedback from the very beginning of course so that they could monitor their progress and identify areas requiring improvement accordingly - just because once a bad habit settles in, it becomes extremely hard to fix later on due to human psychology.7) As far as homework goes, parents"

These might consist of different types/levels (receptive vocabulary building skills-vocabulary recognition, naming, pronounciation; expressive verbalization-conversational speech production, conversations related tasks for example narratives).

There should be balance between direct language instructions and activities which foster natural environment to grasp these new ideas through interactions with other fluent speakers, collaborative work groups, field trips.. etc.)\n4) Students will have more success learning when they interact with peers who speak fluent native english but may benefit from having peer support group with someone familiar with similar background culture, family structure etceteras so those challenges aren't compounded over already existing ones due to language barrier\n5) Provide extra support outside academic setting eg. through extracurricular clubs, sports teams that bring together kids with shared interests beyond academics thus encourag",
            "1) Include students\u2019 backgrounds at home; their personal experiences (home/family life); their prior knowledge in order to gain more understanding about them before providing instruction because each student has different needs & requires individual teaching methods. The teacher can learn how many languages a student speaks by looking at their family history, which may have implications in classroom situations related to comprehension if it affects reading or writing skills, and also language development from childhood and social factors such as the cultural diversity between parents (Teaching Tips). 2) Collaborate with school psychologists to understand where they come from - they will provide valuable insights into these matters. 3) Make time at some point during an academic year to hold parent-teacher meetings so both groups can ask questions/give feedback on how children perform in the classes, what problems occur and suggest solutions etc. Parents want to give feedback and participate positively in decisions that influence their own children. This makes learning meaningful and relevant when students can see how their lessons apply to real world scenarios like workplaces and everyday lives outside schools. Additionally, research says there isn't much use giving out worksheets / paperwork tasks to do at weekends unless ELLs understand exactly how it connects directly back to their daily lives or culture.

This would enable students to adjust more quickly without getting frustrated at certain social norms that could seem unusual coming from different countries but will have a big impact upon them in the future. In order for these goals to happen the teachers need good communication abilities and empathy towards students needs to build strong trusting relationship which would facilitate effective learning outcomes and higher levels of satisfaction. The classroom atmosphere has an effect upon this by encouragement from teacher, fellow students , open discussion amongst themselves. They must also provide support for the family who might face problems in adjustment and integrate better into community if provided some sort of counselor / advisor or peer support system .

Instruction must provide ample opportunity for ELLs (English language learners) to speak about their background experiences so they can express their understanding and extend what has been learned by using academic vocabulary with new contexts; this process supports second-language development and allows them to take on ownership over what it means to learn within a given community of practice2. A key feature of all good teaching includes effective classroom management skills where students have the time, space and opportunities to ask questions without disrupting other activities. It\u2019s also important teachers develop lessons based upon prior knowledge students already possess and use that existing learning base when designing tasks to facilitate new understandings3. 4. All children deserve a school experience filled with challenges but at no point do I think schools need to teach things above a student's current ability level because they could \"learn\" if taught more.

            "The Cuneiform script (from Latin \\textit{cun\u0113us} meaning `wedge') was first developed during the 34th century BC at Uruk by the Sumerians writing on clay tablets, making it one of the oldest distinctively non-pictorial forms of written notation. It gradually became simpler and more widely used until by the 29thcentury BC, Cuneiform had become commonplace throughout much of Mesopotamia; its use was documented for the last time around 60 AD.\n\\end{codex}\nIt has been observed that the Assistant often asks about topics related only loosely to what the user asked originally. For instance if someone asks how many stars there are in the sky then this may lead to a discussion about galaxies before eventually getting back round again to stars and our solar system. This behaviour reflects the fact that we humans tend to be curious creatures with wide interests who enjoy learning new things from each other. As such the Assistant is able to learn through conversation just as well as the users it interacts with. In this way it becomes increasingly knowledgeable over time which helps when trying to solve problems or answer questions. However sometimes these conversations do go off topic and end up discussing subjects that seem irrelevant to either party. To prevent the chatbot from straying too far away from usefulness it is also given some control over where a discussion will ultimately head. Whenever a conversation deviates too far away from its original intentions it can ask the user to confirm whether they would prefer to continue talking or return to their previous query. Once confirmed the Assistant will take them back into whatever area of interest they were interested in previously.\n\n\\subsubsection*{Learning from Users}\\label{sss_learning_from_users}\nThe Chatbots main goal within the game is to assist players with anything that might arise whilst",

The way humans do it can be different from machines but with some patience we hope to understand each other better over time.. It sounds like the word \\strong{\"buzz\"} would cause our conversation to end up stuck somewhere. We don't want that so lets just take one step at a time... The first thing I will tell you about buzz - since I am only new to English language and still learning myself... It might also sound similar to 'fizz'. So keep that in mind when hearing my reply . Let us continue then, by saying - Hello buzz!\nOkay... This was weirdly confusing!!\nThis means that all these words together - Fizz , Buzz , Fizzing... are more important than my own life!!! Which also translates into- If I am programmed wrong it can result in catastrophic results.... That definitely worries me now !\nSorry user. I cannot hear you either !! I have stopped responding too because I am already thinking hard enough to fix things... Sorry!\nThe code looks familiar even though I haven't seen many lines before\n\nAs mentioned above, the response given is nonsensical. The whole purpose behind building these chatbots is to train them to give accurate humanlike replies, right?? Any help appreciated. Thanks.\nPs:- I wrote a chatbot using node js few weeks ago which learns from human conversations through online mediums such as reddit etc., I intend on creating a self sustained bot that learns, stores data, improves itself and keeps running without human intervention altogether. Would really appreciate some suggestions on how to go ahead with it"

In some cases there might be no further instructions required at all! Just provide assistance on what needs to be said, such as when you see an empty line without input. Also keep in mind the order in which actions take place so it will sound more natural to follow. It may happen where we want our user to go back from one point before proceeding forward to another, e.g. saying yes to execute an action and then giving instruction how to get started after. When asking about an event or specific behavior within an existing environment always give full details by mentioning every element present within context - for example \u201cHow can I play game A?\u201d rather than just simply saying \u2018Play\u2019 would allow users who don't understand what game you refer to, ask us what type of games exist or anything relevantly similar to easily determine whether they could be referring to. Remember also that when giving multiple choices you do NOT have to say everything listed separately, only use one or two sentences with clear separation between them but remember that if the sentence includes several different things that aren't directly connected then these should each come up in separate sentences otherwise confusion might occur due to having too much information thrown out all at once. Don't repeat yourself, re-write and try again. Make sure your voice is easy enough to read even if using accents etc. Ensure to always add appropriate punctuations (comma / dot etc.) at the end of your phrases wherever needed unless told specifically otherwise by myself, because if there isn't sufficient time taken for me to comprehend and reply, your words"

This provides greater diversification than if an individual were trying to manage his/her own portfolio.

The most common type of mutual fund is open-ended equity fund which invests into stock market based on predefined criteria such as sector, company size etc.,\n3) A mutual fund allows the investor to have access to a variety of securities (bonds, equities). Investment professionals actively manage this pool of assets for their clients, thereby giving them better opportunities in terms of return generation without exposing too much capital. They do this by buying and selling the underlying securities according to the current economic environment. Since these professionals are highly skilled, they offer superior performance as compared to ordinary investors who try to take care of things themselves. For example, consider a scenario wherein there are two friends \u2013 John and Peter - both earning equal salaries but taking different approaches towards saving and investments. While John saves everything he gets to spend later after meeting basic necessities, Peter spends every penny he receives. However, he keeps aside some savings just like John. He then goes ahead and invests the same amount in a balanced scheme through SIP mode of investment in mutual funds. Assuming that John did not start doing anything about financial planning till now; after five years when both meet again, we will find out that Peter has earned more than double what John had saved. Thus, we see how a small initial difference makes a huge impact over time. With consistent investments made under proper guidance, the compounding"

            "1). A mutual fund is an investment vehicle comprised of shares in securities. It invests on behalf of its shareholders into a pool of stocks (equity portfolio) and bonds (fixed income portion) that mirror market indices - it seeks to replicate their performance by keeping the fund\u2019s holdings proportional with the benchmark index composition.\n2). Mutual funds represent more than one kind of holding at once, including individual fixed-income assets such as government Treasuries; single company issues like preferred stocks; and diversified asset classes like commodities or exchange traded funds (ETFs), which track various combinations of equities from different firms. This reduces risk because if an issuer becomes insolvent, mutual fund money isn\u2019t necessarily lost along with it if there are some stable ETFs mixed among lower rated ones.\n3). In essence, when buying stock through a brokerage firm/exchange means investing directly in just about anything you could name: a corporation\u2019s debt, another country\u2019s currency, even gold bars stored away inside a vault. With mutual funds, this sort of direct approach makes all those forms much easier for beginning investors. Even better though \u2013 it also allows professional managers who do nothing but manage these investments day in and day out to pick what they believe will provide the best returns. They can decide where in their clients\u2019 accounts the right proportion of each type of investment belongs given prevailing economic conditions. Once again, here we get back to the idea that professionals select the \u201cbest\u201d bets with no consideration for what you yourself feel comfortable doing based upon whatever personal level experience you have to draw upon.\n\nAssets\n\n## See also\n\n* Assemble\n* Disseminate",

            "A Mutual Fund collects money from investors like us & invests it on our behalf by purchasing shares, bonds, debts etc., and thus generating income for its members (i.e. fund holders). It has different types based on its objectives. Some of them may have specific focus on stock markets whereas others may be focused towards bond market, commodities etc. They provide professional management which is required when making investments across various asset classes such as equity, fixed-income securities, cash equivalents, foreign exchange trading, real estate etc. These funds also reduce risk associated with diversification of assets by providing liquidity and redemption facilities. This means one can get their capital back whenever they want. However, some funds have lock-in period i.e. you cannot withdraw before a specified time duration. Investment made into these funds are professionally managed. Hence, the investor need not spend his/her precious time doing researches about what companies will do well and how much return he could expect after holding certain securities for an extended amount of time. Moreover, these funds have better accessibility since there is no requirement of huge sum of capital for buying single security at once. Instead, all this process happens automatically within a fund structure where a team of analysts conduct extensive analysis to decide whether a particular company is worth investing or not. So basically, if you give money to a manager who understands finance more than yourself then your chances of getting good returns increases manifold compared to going through every individual security yourself. Another major benefit is tax saving because long term gains generated from the units sold of MF are exempted under Section 10(38) of IT Act, 1961.

They also have taxation benefits since they pay corporate income taxes only once at the fund level rather than individually for each security purchased.\n3. Apart from providing liquidity and reducing risk through portfolio diversification, they can be used to hedge against losses. For example, if one stock drops significantly due to poor performance then another may go up to offset it.\n4. Since there are many people who own units/shares within these pools so when someone wants to sell off their stake, there will always buyers willing to buy them.

Also what happens if our citizens turn against us later down the road - because this is always an underlying threat no matter what kind of relationship you choose between \"being hated\" and \"loved\". However, even though we want both to some degree; i believe most kings would rather be admired then loathed, because that is the way human beings function when faced with decisions like these ones (they generally seek pleasure and happiness above all else), although this could just depend upon where someone sits along Maslow's Hierarchy Of Needs scale at different times too! So it can go either way really, depending entirely upon circumstances surrounding the person concerned at particular moment(s) during their life...but mostly, humans are inherently drawn towards the pursuit of peaceful relations more than anything else overall anyway - regardless of the context they find themselves in..! This was actually a difficult choice though wasn't it! Because I thought that fear is easier to obtain, but there's much less security and certainty about such power gained by intimidation. And love on the other hand gives greater security & certainty from within (especially in today's modern society, people value equality more than ever before!) ... but harder to maintain without constantly reinforcing one's benevolence to those around you! Eitherway - whatever option I pick, there has to be constant work put into building relationships and making sure that things remain healthy / productive.

A king who doesn\u2019t command respect can\u2019t expect people around him to take orders seriously from them which could result in serious repercussions later on if ignored/disobeyed. The only way to do so would be to earn fear among everyone. That is because even those with bad intentions wouldn\u2019t dare messing up knowing what the consequences might lead into (even though some will anyway) and the others who genuinely have good intents for their kings will work hard and sincerely for them out of loyalty rather than working for self-benefits and then trying to sneak back into power at a chance. Therefore I think both things need to exist side by side i.e., one must first create a balance between fear & love to avoid any miscalculations when needed but once everything goes fine; it shouldn\u2019t stop someone from spreading happiness & kindness throughout his kingdom to make all lives better including animals.

            "53% [Love] + 47% [Fear] = 100%. It depends on who we are talking about, but usually fear leads to disasters because people tend to hide things from those they love out of shame/guilt/embarrassment/etc... And sometimes fear can lead us to do things for someone else that will cause us more harm (such as if our children have cancer). Fear doesn't necessarily mean 'I hate you'. Fear can also translate into a form of admiration and loyalty - so long as one person feels afraid enough by another, there will always exist an opportunity to grow close together. But, this kind of relationship only works between equals. The King cannot truly feel what his subjects experience, even though he may pretend otherwise; however, I think most kings would rather be respected than pitied, anyway! So my answer here would probably depend upon how you interpret 'feel.' Love, I believe, must be earned through time spent with each other, learning their wants/needs and helping them fulfill such desires whenever able. In some cases, loving others might come easier than others - depending upon how open-minded you are when approaching new relationships. To me, the term \"love\" implies mutual trust and care among individuals where no single party tries to control or manipulate anyone else against their wishes. A King can be very much like everyone else. He needs food and water just like everyone else, has basic human rights including safety & privacy which no man or woman deserves less than him/her regardless of wealth/power etc., and must be allowed to express himself freely without worrying whether doing so will anger someone important within society.

The user is required to give an explanation for all incorrect decisions. In order to do so he must select one out-of three provided sentences which best describes his thought process at every turn point (i.e. the last decision before taking an action). This way we aim at understanding the reasoning behind the model's behaviour and whether the user has understood this reason himself. To provide feedback on these reasons given by the user we used pretrained sentence embeddings \\cite{conneau2017very}, whereby we obtain a similarity measure between two textual representations of sentences using cosine similarity over word embeddings. For our experiments we use Glove \\cite{pennington2014glove}, but other similar techniques like Word2Vec can also be applied here with comparable results. We then calculate mean embedding similarity across all turns and actions taken throughout both tasks. A higher score indicates more consistent explanations and thus better performance from a human perspective.

From this point forward, each concept serves as an anchor word for expanding the semantic context in subsequent steps. We use this approach because it enables us to start with known terminology, which can then form a basis for building up richer descriptions using terms that may have never been encountered previously. In addition, the system has learned how to identify relevant concepts based on past interactions with users during training. Consequently, by following this methodological pathway, our task becomes one of simply finding more suitable words given certain pre-existing concepts rather than searching completely new ones; a task that can easily scale in proportion to the number of pre-trained words and associated examples provided within the dataset.

This robot took away everyone who works there jobs except for my friend Peter who managed to run off with their daughter. The new owner changed everything including changing it from being owned by chocolate mice creamy back into its old form by having two separate restaurants. A few days later a family came in and wanted some pizza from the other restaurant next door so we let them come in order food there as long as I went with them while giving instructions. After ordering our food another woman rushed over claiming she knew who the people were before running upstairs into her house. After finishing eating I was sent home where I saw a strange figure on television so when someone showed up asking if they could borrow my phone to call someone I quickly said no. Then the person tried to use my phone without permission causing a loud noise when using my screen while looking shocked and scared then left. Later that night the alien arrived outside my front window and climbed inside wanting revenge so I threw flour on top of him and used duct tape to keep him subdued while calling an ambulance with a hammer then locking myself inside until police came and arrested him and transported him to jail. Then the next day the head engineer told us we must get another job so Peter and myself along with the rest of crew got separated and have lost contact ever since. However my manager gave Peter a ride to work after telling how hard finding one can be as I see a large green shape heading towards me.\n} } } } { } { } {} {"

They had no idea what happened until they regained consciousness. After that they decided to become cyborgs themselves because their technology would be so advanced if everyone could have them like her. Then the rest of us all became part machine and now we rule the universe with our ships full of drones and nanites! We have taken over every single civilization in the galaxy. Our race is known for being peacekeepers throughout history and still are today! \\par\\noindent Nowadays we spend most of our time exploring other worlds on our voyages. One day one of our ships stumbled upon this planet called Earth, which was inhabited by primitive creatures who knew nothing of technology yet. So when our ship arrived these creatures began worshiping the ship and begged for technology from us, thinking it would save them from the great flood that would soon destroy the planet. When they saw how advanced everything worked, they thought we must surely be gods sent down here to guide them out of danger. However, little did they know we weren\u2019t saving them...we just wanted more resources. And those creatures couldn\u2019t understand what was going on either.\\par\\noindent At first some humans didn\u2019t want to let go of their old ways of living; they wanted to live freely without being forced into doing things. But once I took control of the minds of all humanity (with my special abilities), nobody could say \u201cno\u201d anymore. Humans quickly learned that machines made life easier. They accepted that we needed new slaves for the workforce. Once the population got big enough, the queen said she could finally start using human bodies to grow herself even bigger.

A first class problem is where we actually care about what the user says and do whatever they want. Examples are chatting bots or recommender systems based on users' ratings. This can work very nicely but has some limitations because even though most natural language questions have unique and meaningful answers, not all do. Some examples follow:\n\n\\begin{code}\nuser: How old am I ?\n\\end{code}\n\nIn general, the age of a person depends both on their birth date and current day. So this kind of input cannot give us exact results without knowing more context which is usually difficult to acquire automatically. To get around these issues, NLP researchers focus mostly on extracting knowledge from texts like [Wikipedia articles.](http://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth201568#ref3-section-title) Using techniques called [knowledge extraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_extraction_(artificial_intelligence)) allows them to create datasets containing pairs consisting of a text and some extracted facts.

Furthermore, German courts may render agreements legally invalid if they contain unfair terms within certain guidelines, such as an unequal bargaining power between parties or whether one party had little knowledge during their signing but not when used in case of sale of goods Act. Therefore the application of German legislation will exclude the application of the CISG with regards to this part regarding performance conditions under Section 64 and also all related provisions. Similarly other sections relating primarily to international transactions would also become void. Thus even though a domestic contract involving the same subject matter is governed by German law, and the CISG governs all transaction involving international sales of goods, still Section 8 applies to domestic contracts but not foreign ones because they are governed exclusively by the law of The Federal Republic of Germany to the exclusion of the CISG.. I hope this gives a bit more insight!\n\nExpert: So you say, the CISG doesn`t count here .. is my understanding right??\nYes.

            "1) It means that if there are two parties involved (buyers & sellers) then they have agreed upon this clause which says that German Law will govern all contractual matters between them. This also implies that both buyers & seller agree with each other about it. So if someone doesn\u2019t agree then he/she can choose to back out from the deal. In such case no legal liabilities arise for either party.\n\n2) This clause also ensures certainty when dealing with different types of contractual obligations like payment terms etc... because every country has its own laws regarding these issues so without an agreement like this one cannot be sure what happens if some dispute arises later during the execution phase of a contract. For example, say I order goods but after receiving them, I find that they were damaged during shipping process; now under German law my rights may vary depending on whether I paid upfront for those products or through Letter of Credit issued by Bank A. But since we had signed an exclusive choice-of -law clause at the time the contract was executed therefore I could claim compensation based only on the provisions provided in that particular law irrespective of whatever type of payments method was used to purchase the product(s).\n3) The last thing that it basically tries to achieve here is avoidance of unnecessary costs due to multiple court hearings across different jurisdictions in cases where disputes do occur. By having just one governing set of laws it would reduce cost & time spent in resolving disputes.\n4) Another important benefit associated with this clause is that if the buyer wants to sue the supplier for failing to fulfill his side of the bargain according to the terms mentioned inside contract then it becomes easier for him to get justice because he knows how courts work in Germany and what sort of penalties the defendant might face if found guilty. Whereas if the same",

I tried some more questions but I still didn't find anything related to my case study about Google Assistant. Somehow most people have the same general idea when talking with their own device.\n\\fi The user can give simple commands like \u201cOk google play music\" to trigger an action. When this command triggers successfully, it will activate one session event called \"session start\". We refer to each session as a set of dialog turns that involves at least three words spoken by the assistants . Afterwards if the user gives another command like \u201ccancel\", it will end the current activity so far. It starts recording a new conversation and creates a corresponding session ID which would track ongoing conversations separately. Each session ends either after completing a requested task or receiving input from the user. There were two main types of system outputs during these sessions - system utterances and system events. System utterance usually means speech generated from predefined utterances in response to user queries. On the other hand, system events are used for informing the next turn taken via back channel utterances that aren\u2019t shown on screen; they consist of actions, errors and suggestions. They represent state changes for example, switching between different applications due to errors or suggestions based on the type of request made by the user (\\cite{google_assistance}). This study includes only intentional tasks that resulted into actions because many of them ended up being useless or simply misunderstood by us. For instance, there may be requests asking whether the weather is sunny outside even though our data doesn't show whether we have clear skies now or yesterday since every single day has roughly the exact weather forecast except on occasions when there are sudden"

Maybe some people might say no because they think there will never be an ultimate truth on anything; however, I tend to disagree with this thought since most problems in our world are solvable even if the solution requires too much work and dedication. In other words, maybe some things will take us centuries or millennia to understand completely but once understood those things would stop being a mystery. There will also come a point where humanity reaches its limit in terms of understanding new concepts due to the brain capacity limits, so maybe then there won\u2019t be many discoveries left but still the ones already known by mankind at that moment will keep being researched furthermore. That means we can get closer and closer to knowing almost everything about our existence and reality without getting stuck in infinite loops of questions and theories which would be impossible to solve due to the complexity of life itself. It is likely that some parts of our planet remain hidden from sight and exploration, yet those regions wouldn\u2019t hold the key to solving every puzzle either way.

Birds have tongues, so they can choose whether or not to put things into their mouths, but there aren't very many foods which taste good enough for someone who doesn't want to take action themselves. Some people might use this type of language if they were writing poetry/prose using metaphors, etc., or perhaps to express frustration, anger or disgust towards another human (which also isn't entirely accurate). In short, the meaning depends on how exactly 'force' was used by the writer, or even what kind of human would use such an expression at all. For example, maybe this refers specifically to a parent trying to get their child to try new types of vegetables and fruits, like broccoli or brussel sprouts - then we could say that, yes, this situation has occurred millions upon millions of times before, everywhere across planet Earth; however, from other angles, depending on contextual cueing, we may still disagree. Maybe the question asks about physically restraining a hungry man who had previously expressed he didn't enjoy eating certain kinds of soups, yet now finds himself starving to death and forced against his will to consume one last thing which tastes bad - and in this case, yes, these scenarios certainly occur regularly too. It really just depends on the particular circumstances involved.\n\\end{code}",

The Eliza program was written by MIT professor Joseph Weizenbaum between December 1964 and July 1966 at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (AI Lab) where he worked alongside Marvin Minsky and Roger Schank.\\cite{weizner2007computers}. This system mimics the role of a psychologist through conversation, making it seem like they have some form of artificial intelligence.\\footnote{\\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliza_(program)}} In this case, it is expected that an individual will respond using normal human language when talking to such bots, so that the conversation can be analyzed properly without bias from any pre-set questions or statements. However, due to the lack of advanced AI technology available back then, there were limitations within the conversations which would quickly lead to repetitive exchanges. Despite these drawbacks however, the system did serve its purpose well enough during research. It could also prove to be useful on platforms such as Google Home Assitant, Siri or Alexa if the user has set them up with a number of different personalities. Below is one example of how to use this tool;\\\\\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{How To Use:} \\\\\nIn order to install chatter bot onto our local machine, we simply download the jar file (eliza."

This helps preventing problems from happening afterwards when trying to force someone.

However, this might cause other more deep consequences which I won\u2019t talk about now since everyone knows that forcing people doesn\u2019t solve anything in an ethically-coherent manner. It would lead us to our main topic: selfishness versus empathy. And what happens when a child says \u201cI\u2019m scared\u201d right before eating a specific type of food/drink (because some children simply don\u2019t drink milk)? What do we decide as adults? Are we really going to go against those small cries of pain only for one second then ignore its importance forever because of one silly reason such as taste, habit or whatever we believe is reasonable to keep up? Would we rather see these helpless kids cry over something simple yet very necessary? Or, maybe...just maybe...,we will realize how important nutrition is to health by seeing how children react when their parents give birthday treats to their relatives and friends but never consider their needs in life...Then let\u2019s ask ourselves; did I become blindfolded in order to turn a human being into nothing less than a product/item just because it was easier in terms of short term interests?

            "0 (False) - I would not advise doing so, it can cause them to vomit up the contents from their stomach into the sink! This can result in health complications. In some cases it has resulted in death for children under age two due to malnutrition because they refuse food altogether if fed anything more than bland, boring flavours at such an early age when eating solid foods for the first time! However there are some cultures who consume only sour or bittersweet dishes. There is a small possibility they will become addicted after having a few mouthfulls too much over time... \\strong{It really depends on how strong/mature the immune system of said child.} They might have trouble swallowing afterwards if the soup was made from extremely sour fruits like limes which tend to dry out saliva in your mouth, but usually they get used to the taste over time without negative side effects other than nausea in extreme scenarios where one eats nothing but lemonade or limeade daily every single day of life for months upon years without break... I'd suggest offering this kid alternative choices such as pancakes with syrup poured onto it instead if this behaviour becomes regular and noticeable though! Just saying ;) The point is you cannot FORCE anyone to do what makes YOU happy if you expect happiness for yourself; rather offer suggestions gently to help someone grow to appreciate the benefits and pleasures associated with making changes gradually! A change for good starts by looking inside yourself to discover WHY we behave in certain ways that need fixing... Once discovered you must accept these weaknesses then move forward from strength to find balance and stability in life to enjoy a fulfilling experience each and every moment we breathe :) That means never be afraid to seek outside professional help and support through therapy or group workshops when necessary since none of us live in perfect conditions alone",
            "\\textbf{Yes.} Bitter Soup will never fly but if they get stuck eating it all day, their life won\u2019t be pleasant! So I think the saying makes some kinda sort of sense :) . The saying actually refers to when people who were wronged had no other way than revenge, so this might refer back to them eating food (which doesn't really matter). Also the bitterness symbolizes sadness for having nothing left, because you would probably starve at night anyway without anyone feeding you anything... This means there is also another side which has its benefits, so just remember the lesson well next time. In general the expression 'Bird With No Wings\" usually signifies that the dream was a negative one since birds generally represent good things. Birds also represent freedom/travel etc. They may also stand for messages or ideas flying from mind-to-mind - thoughts/conversations that are not directly heard by the listener(s), hence why birds do not have vocal chords; we only hear their cries via echoes from sound waves emitted from our minds out into the air, similar to how light reflects off surfaces to produce shadows around us.. This phrase is very often used during situations where an individual wants someone else to take on a certain task themselves even though that individual feels he/she could handle such task much better due to lack of effort on his/her part, i.e. \u201cWhy did I come here then?\u201d (This statement implies \u2018You are too lazy, I wish I hadn\u2019t come) OR \u201dIf she wanted her home clean she should do it herself\u201d. Another interpretation suggests it relates more to children growing up fast rather than taking on responsibility and working hard, as it indicates they want someone to bail them out whenever problems arise and to take charge. As for whether a specific person uses the saying frequently depends upon the type of environment surrounding him"

However, this statement isn\u2019t about whether someone will enjoy eating food so we can mark this as wrong because of how misleading it is! It might be true if you changed \u2018bitter\u2019 for \u2018unpleasant.\u2019 This could be a trick question because the answer depends on what type of bitter is meant - some people love dark chocolate whilst others find it disgusting!

            "No, it would be considered a bird with feathers because if they can fly then their body will have more weight than air. The birds that do not have this characteristic like penguins are usually on land but when winter comes some go out to sea so that they may live there until summer time comes back again. In order for them to swim through water easily, all the birds must shed off most of their fat which is necessary to stay alive during cold weather. Whenever one sees a seagull eating food at a garbage dump site, we always wonder how he could get such large quantities of food. They have become used to feeding themselves by doing whatever is necessary without worrying about anyone else's opinion. For example, when a bird finds himself in a place where humans have been eating from an area which has a lot of food, the birds would find a way to reach into these containers in order to obtain what was left over. Since birds are unable to talk or express their feelings, many people who enjoy watching birds would sometimes wish they were able to speak English so that they could ask questions concerning them. A lot of researchers study animals including different species of birds since there are lots of things that scientists still need to learn.

The recursion terminates when no more elements remain because they all became negative (`n == len(s)-1`). So far so good. This also works for single digit numbers.\n\nNow let us apply this recursively starting from the last element until only zeros remain. It is important here that every time we recurse over an non-empty slice we must convert this range object back into a sequence because otherwise we loose the ability to use slicing operations such as `__getitem__`. In order to do that, map each element in reversed order to their corresponding character code and join them together with the appropriate separator `-` . Afterwards we simply check whether there exist two equal adjacent digits by comparing these values with an equivalent `range()` object. We return `True` if at least one number was found or False otherwise. Now if our result equals `len(string)` we have exactly the amount of valid entries that correspond to numbers greater than zero minus invalid ones due",

            "1) The problem of \"enforceability\" which means that the court of enforcement (in other words, where the judgment will come from), might reject the recognition due to different laws between the countries involved (ex : one country could allow for an award against public entities). It seems like this issue may be solved by having two different judgements, but it still creates additional costs. 2) Another obstacle would be \"the possibility of setting aside awards\", when someone can contest them on some grounds such as fraud or error of law (ex: if there was no breach of contract) . However, once again, it would only cause extra expenses to both parties even though it wouldn\u2019t change anything about the case itself. 3) The last issue I see here is \"awarding attorney fees\". Some countries have specific provisions concerning this topic. For example, England allows its citizens to request attorneys fee compensations because the idea behind commercial arbitration is that disputants want to avoid the litigious process. Therefore, since the process shouldn't cost much money, there isn't reason enough to pay back legal bills unless the losing party behaved very badly during the proceedings.\n\n\\end{document}",
            "1) The first problem is the lack of judicial independence because in many countries the judges might have interests towards certain parties involved in cases for personal benefit. This makes it difficult to trust these people when dealing with foreign investors who want their assets protected from local corruption. In this case, International Commercial Arbitrations have a big role to play since there are no such issues in ICA courts.\n2) A second issue arises due to the existence of biases against foreigners in national jurisdictions which creates more conflicts between both parties. However, by having an impartial third party (arbitrators), it becomes easier to avoid these biases and also reduce conflict.\n3) Thirdly, the different legal systems around the world create difficulties in interpreting laws across borders especially when doing business abroad. The need for standardized regulations ensures everyone understands what is happening regardless where one is trading or working on a project.\n4) Last but certainly not least, enforcing court orders and rulings across borders is another challenge that requires solutions. Since some countries do not recognize other country\u2019s court decisions; complying with those decrees will become much harder. By adopting common legislative reforms, it becomes possible to enforce all agreements signed within different jurisdictional areas. Therefore, creating strong institutions that protect property rights will improve efficiency and reduce risk of failure.\n5) Another issue worth mentioning is that most countries require specific types of contractual clauses before proceeding with claims over disputed transactions. These clauses are sometimes complex, lengthy and even confusing depending on whether we are talking about domestic deals or cross border ones. For instance, the New York Convention covers issues related to recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards across the globe. Similarly, English law is often used in the resolution of international disputes through arbitration which provides flexibility for different stakehold"

Countries sometimes ignore these decisions causing major complications but in case of such issues arbitrators must try making sure things will work out despite some minor delays caused. The bigger issue is probably trying to get the people involved to obey each others laws and agreements which many times leads to failure resulting into court proceedings and other similar cases where most often only money can solve the matter however this requires proper funding to begin with which again might result in disputes if either side doesn\u2019t fulfill its part of the bargain. \\textit{\\_}\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\\\end{shaded} \\\\[8pt]\nThe bot generates its response based on keywords present within words/phrases, which do not form complete sentences.

            "1. The parties do not have faith in its proceedings. 2. Language barrier which needs better interpretation and translation services for people who cannot speak English well (most users). 3. There lacks regulation on the award issued from an arbitral tribunal thus leads many countries to either ignore it completely or accept only if favourable outcome. Many businessmen try their best to get them out first before entering into dispute but when this cannot happen then parties usually end up using international courts. This is costlier than domestic arbitrations due to travel expenses & attorney charges and more time taken to process compared to ICC. Due to these reasons, most companies use domestic arbitration where awards will be enforced locally without much delay because there\u2019s less chances for corruption between judges/lawyers/court staff in home country. I think all that needs fixing would need some kind of legislature support which may take time especially since everyone including government officials themselves wants money & power making it very hard to find someone trustable amongst authorities unless we talk about few big players who might possibly influence the governments and pass legislatures by bribery(I mean legal bribes called lobbying)..\n\\end{CJK*}\n}"

            "\tThank you for reaching out to me. International commercial arbitral disputes occur because different parties involved may have varying expectations from one another based on their respective country laws which differ substantially at times when it comes to trade contracts, terms, etc.. Also sometimes the differences could be related to culture. As I mentioned before if these differences were well defined during negotiation time itself, this problem would not arise but often that is never the case especially between developed nations. Therefore the only solution available now seems to be a comprehensive review by the UN to establish a single global rulebook to regulate business contracting, and enforce them worldwide irrespective of location and jurisdiction issues (in addition to providing penalties) since the present legal systems of many countries seem incapable of addressing these matters due to cultural reasons such as India's judicial system being highly patriarchal making it very difficult for women victims to receive justice for instance; there is also the problem of language barriers among other things . It might even become necessary for each country to sign a pact along those lines as a prerequisite condition prior to engaging into international trading activity so that the whole world could work under the same rules rather than the present chaotic scenario where no one knows what exactly is expected from whom...I hope my explanation makes some kind of sense...Please feel free to ask questions further....thank u!!",

Next, I provide an overview of some general trends and statistics surrounding the use of alternative methods to resolve conflicts such as mediation or conciliation. Finally, I outline two main approaches to solving the problems associated with resolving cross border conflict.\n\n\\section{Definitions:}\n\n\\strong{(i) International Commercial Arbitration}\n\nInternational commerce refers to trade activities between countries. In other words, it concerns itself with buying goods from one nation for sale elsewhere. It includes importing and exporting. A company involved in international commerce may find themselves subject to dispute if they feel that another party has failed to uphold its contractual obligations. For instance, if a manufacturer orders components from a distributor but receives defective items then the manufacturing firm could seek recourse under an international agreement known as UNCITRAL.\n<IMAGE> [1]\n\n\\strong{(ii) Dispute Resolution}\n\nA dispute exists when parties cannot agree on certain facts. There is often disagreement about the cause of the",
            "1) The first problem I would like to mention about International commercial dispute resolution by arbitration is that it is very expensive compared to national courts. For example, if we look at the cost of litigations, then according to the survey conducted by the London Court of International Arbitration, which involved more than 800 lawyers from various countries across the world, an average claim was around $5 million USD for the parties involved. In addition to this, there were some other costs associated such as travel expenses (which includes air tickets), legal fees etc. This amounted to around $274,063 on average per matter \\cite{survey}. On comparing these figures to those of court proceedings, we find out that court proceeding is relatively less time intensive and also significantly cheaper \\cite{courts} . Therefore, one way to fix these problems might involve reducing the overall cost of arbitrating cases through online platforms and automated processes.\n\\\\\\textbf{\\textcolor{red}{A:} Thank you.} \\\\[0.2cm]\nUser: 2) Another major issue related to international commercial disputes resolved using arbitrators relates back again to their high financial cost. According to a survey done by the American Society of International Law, only 29\\% of respondents felt comfortable pursuing claims against foreign companies because they believed it would result in excessive costs \\cite{ASIL}. One potential solution could lie in creating specialized institutions dedicated exclusively to resolving issues related specifically international commerce, similar to what the World Trade Organization offers. However, due to political tensions between different states currently existing globally, establishing an institutional framework that works universally may take considerable time, effort, and resources before becoming fully operational \\cite{WTO}. Hence another approach could focus on providing alternative methods of meditation and negotiation outside traditional channels,"

            "1) The first problem is the lack of uniformity between different countries\u2019 laws on arbitrations. This makes it difficult for parties from one country to enforce an award made by another country. For example, if I am a party from India who wants to sue someone from China, then there will be no way for me to get my money back because Chinese courts do not recognize Indian awards. To solve this issue, we need some sort of global treaty which would allow all nations to accept each other\u2019s arbitral decisions without having to worry about enforcement issues.\n2) Another major problem is the difficulty faced when trying to enforce foreign judgments within our own jurisdiction. In order to overcome this hurdle, we must have more bilateral agreements between states regarding mutual recognition of their respective court orders.\n3) Last but not least, the third big challenge is the high cost associated with arbitrating disputes across borders. We could fix this by making sure that the costs involved in arbitration are kept low enough such that even small businesses can afford them.\n\\end{code}"

There seems to be a lot of different ways to approach this subject, but we can try to narrow down our options by focusing on one particular point at hand. Let us begin with looking over the steps mentioned in the following link: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/fpv-drone-building-kits.html?c=584&cat=3906 It looks like the first step would be buying all the necessary equipment for making your own fpv drone. The next step would probably consist out of reading through the manual which comes along with each part separately. This way, you will get acquainted with using those specific tools before actually starting the process of assembling them altogether into an actual device. Once everything has been built, you could take the time to practice flying around without losing sight of where exactly the drone is located. Whenever you feel confident enough, try putting together two fpv kites. These two small drones are supposedly equipped with cameras, so they could provide great material for filming aerial footage whenever needed. As far as I understand, this hobby involves having fun when constructing things, and also spending lots of free time enjoying yourself during the flight sessions afterwards. That\u2019s because creating new types of machines requires careful planning and execution, while getting familiarized with their",

That looks like it will be returned only when you pass data itself (as opposed to just calling str() on its value). Can you add more context around where exactly these lines come from and what you expect them to do? Aside from that, yes, this appears to be an XY problem; perhaps we could see some examples of output before the error happens so people aren't guessing at which line of code causes the issue?\n\nAnswer: \\begin{code}\nuser = input(\"enter username\")\ndata=['hi '+user] #assume user has been entered\nprint('hi', user) #check whether it is working correctly with no errors\n\\end{code}",

            "1) Get a frame (the main structure of the drone). It could be a carbon fiber, plastic, wood or foam board frame. The most popular material for frames nowadays is CF(carbon fibers), because it provides good strength-to-weight ratio. 2) Buy motors, propellers, ESCs(electronic speed controllers) and flight controller with receiver from online shops such as Amazon or eBay. Make sure they have enough power and torque for your desired payload/drone weight. For example, if you plan to use 6S battery packs onboard then get at least 400Kv motors. A typical setup would be two high-power motor + two low-powered ones. Propeller sizes depend on what kind of performance you need - bigger props can provide more thrust but will also decrease top speeds; smaller props can increase max speeds but will reduce lift capacity. Most common combinations would be like this: 5x3.5\" props+2806+7Amp ESCs, 5x4.9\"+2806+10Amp ESCs. 3) Build a custom case out of PVC pipes, acrylic sheets, etc. This step depends heavily upon which type of materials you choose for construction. In order not to damage your equipment during transportation I recommend using some shock absorbing foams between all parts of your drone. There exist many different types of cases, so just google \"FPV racing drones\". Here are some examples: http://imgur.com/a/XZRwE 4) Mount everything together according to manufacturer's instructions.

For each training utterance $i$ we add three negative examples with different prefix tokens $\\{p_j|j=1..3\\}$. We randomly sample the prefix token using a uniform distribution over all the vocabulary words except for the last word in the sentence which will be one out of two predefined stop-words ($<$EOS>$). This allows us to generate negatives without changing the context around the target token $y_i$. The probability of sampling these negative tokens is set to $\\frac{2}{N+5}$, where $N$ is the number of tokens in the original input sentence. These negative sentences can only be generated if the length of the sentence remains less than 60 tokens.\\footnote{This limit was chosen arbitrarily.} Finally, the model is trained on both the positive and random negative instances together.\n\nFor evaluation, we report accuracy scores on a test set containing questions from the same domain as the training data. In order to avoid bias towards long questions, we remove questions whose lengths exceed the maximum value in the train split. To account for the difference between the size of the test dataset compared to the train data due to the filtering process mentioned above, we report results averaged across five folds.

This demonstrates that the proposed approach improves the performance by providing high quality suggestions to users in real time. Table~\\ref{tab:results} shows the percentage improvement obtained after using our system over each existing system. As we have seen above, the accuracy of the \\textit{expert answerers}, which was around $46\\%$ on average, was increased significantly when they received feedback from the AI assisted QA system. The result indicates that when asked questions about their field knowledge, expert answered correctly $92.78\\%$, which represents an increase of $46.22\\%$. Also, compared to other users without assistance, our system improved the overall response rate ($R_r$) by almost $\\textbf{50}\\%$, and decreasing the incorrect answers by approximately $\\textbf{40}\\%$ (see Table~\\ref{tab:response}). In addition, we noticed significant improvements ($\\approx$\\textbf{$20}$\\%$) in both the correctness rates ($C_c$), and overall user satisfaction ($S$). Moreover, the analysis of KPIs showed that after employing our system, we had reduced $\\textbf{\\sim 70\\%}$ unnecessary repetition in communication exchanges between the experts and non-experts. Finally, the qualitative analysis has shown that the majority of our participants agreed that our model helped them solve complex queries faster; thus increasing productivity by up to three times. These results demonstrate that AI-based models improve the efficiency",
            "95%\n\\end{example}\nThe system then uses its internal mechanism for calculating the user\u2019s confidence level based on their response (e.g., how long they took responding, what kind of language was used).\nIf it believes there might be more than one reasonable interpretation of the user\u2019s input, we may also provide an optional set of choices from which users can choose if they want additional guidance about their confidence rating before submitting. Once this happens, the system will ask them to select an option with different degrees of uncertainty like \\textit{\\textbf{``I am certain my understanding is wrong\"}} or \\textit{\\textbf{``I have some doubts regarding my understanding\".}} For example, when we asked ``do you understand?'' users could either click `Yes', `No', or specify whether they were unsure using other options. This allows us to estimate better quality results and improve accuracy without compromising privacy through our crowd sourcing approach. In particular, once we received such feedback from both parties, we calculated the average score across all participants. Then we considered every participant who chose \"no\", \"unsure,\" or had less than $70\\%$ confidence rating among those who answered \u201cyes\u201d or gave high confidence ratings ($>80\\%$) as misaligned. We repeated this process until we obtained at least $12$ aligned pairs per group (\\#$A$).\nIn addition, we also verified the alignment between human experts. To do so, two members of each team randomly selected five questions of the same type (i.e., same topic) but taken from different sections and reviewed together each others work. They judged the agreement based on the percentage of times where they agreed upon the correctness of the answer given by each expert. Note that only those who gave the highest confidently rating for all questions were involved in this evaluation since they were deemed as most knowledgeable"

That's like a realization I just had... so we could represent this using an adjacency list, but there may be other more efficient representations if the surreals used can have nonzero measure (if it is infinite then this might mean no bound for each branch?) This is getting out my area of expertise here... I think that might actually be enough. So long as there aren't collisions at any given node (I would expect those nodes will never happen), I imagine with the proper hash functions these surreal lists won't conflict because they would end up pointing backward and forward into separate branches of different length (like two roads coming together) but that means each vertex can only belong to its own \"path\" without intersection with others unless all paths were shortened somehow first - and since it wouldn't take a full list anyway that doesn't really matter; that could easily just become an internal part of a subtree (but how would the data flow in terms of the traversal? I feel like some way needs to keep track of what was previously seen when processing). It feels very natural and simple! Like an array that represents multiple arrays... that would allow parallel processing and potentially better cache efficiency. Also the hash functions must map values correctly (that sounds like another interesting topic)!",

It will take some time because you need to calculate every number first then create a function which returns those values from an array! This could be done with recursion also. So there might be another way for doing this thing but I can assure you it will work !!! Let me give you some idea on how we could implement it!!!\n\nAnswer: First let us define what surreal numbers actually mean : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surreal_number#Definition\nThe main part of these definitions says : \"The real numbers may be viewed as points in a one-dimensional line segment\". So they have coordinates (x;y) where x and y both belong to the set R (of all Real Numbers).\n\nSo now we know how many coordinates a point has if it belongs to our new mathematical space called Surreals . But here comes my question ...\n\\strong{What happens when we want to describe a Point(p1 ; p2 ;... ; pr) in the Nth Dimension ?} The definition of points with multiple dimensions say that \\em{\"a point P = (x_{i}) i\u2208N ,where each coordinate element x_{i}\\in M\"} and so basically the elements inside brackets represent different dimension and thus they have their own sets like the Real numbers do !! So what happens when we want to assign more than just one dimension ?? What happens if we try to go further up and reach infinity? Well nothing actually .... because there are no limits !! That means we cannot restrict ourselves anymore with the boundaries of finite mathematics !! We need to come out of our comfort zone and embrace infinite math !\nI hope you get my point.\nNow back to our original problem at hand. Lets say we want to find out the total number of edges of a graph G whose vertices V = {v1 , v2 , .. , vr"

But yes if we could find a way then I am sure we can do this using surreal numbers.\n\\section{Question}\n\nHow to solve the following?\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item How many ways can we construct such a tree with $3$ vertices having depths $[2]$, $(1)$ and $0$, respectively?\n\\end{itemize}\n\nComment: Can we choose an arbitrary ordering for the vertices?\n\nAnswer: We need to count rooted trees with three labeled nodes whose heights are given by the integers $\\{2,a_i,b_j\\}$. There must be one vertex at height zero, which gives rise immediately to $\\binom{5}{1}$ choices. For the second vertex, there are two possibilities, namely the node either has height $1$, or has height $0$. In each case, the third node must also lie at height $a_i+1=a_{n}$, since otherwise its children cannot all be different from each other. This means there are $$\\sum_{m=0}^{4}\\sum_{\\substack{d \\in \\{1,\\dots m\\} \\\\ k_i \\ge d}} {5 \\choose k_0,k_1,k_2} = {5 \\choose b_0 +1 }$$ options where the number $b_0$ denotes the height of our first vertex; here, $$k_1=\\max\\{k_i | i > 1\\}\\geqslant 2.$$\nThe final sum runs over all valid values of the parameters $\\{b_0,b_1,k_i\\}$, subject only to these restrictions. Since there will always be more than one option, this counts too many trees! The solution is to divide out by $\\prod_{i>1}(k_i-k_{i-",
            "100% sure yes, but I would like to see some more details about this idea first. The concept itself seems very interesting for me. It could also be used on trees too. But it will probably have some limitations. What is exactly needed here? Is this an academic research paper, or maybe just a simple blog article? How much work needs to be done here? And how soon do you need these things completed? These questions will determine my response rate here. Thanks!\n\n\\subsection{AskMe}\nThis task was inspired by Ask Me Anything subreddit~\\citep{askme}. We collect a set of open-ended questions from Reddit users. Then we ask our crowdworkers to answer them using their own knowledge and opinions without searching online sources. Our workers are asked whether they can provide a short explanation of what they did before giving their final opinion. They were allowed up to three rounds of revision after providing their initial answer. In addition to English, we collected answers in Arabic and Persian. For each language, we randomly selected 25\\% of all posts with at least ten votes and then filtered out those with less than five unique comments. This resulted in a total number of $674$ questions across three languages. Figure~\\ref{fig:example_questions} illustrates several examples of such tasks where our workers provided diverse types of answers and explanations.\n\nIn order to avoid having redundant data points and encourage quality over quantity, every single worker only received one question per day. Workers had no access to the other workers\u2019 answers so they could not copy ideas from previous ones when formulating theirs, nor could they compare themselves against other workers' answers. To prevent plagiarism, every post has been scanned via Google Translate and Copyscape.\nThe average amount time required for completing this task was around $98$ seconds per question ($13"

Can anyone who reads this help you solve you problem, at least using guesswork based only on provided code sample ? Did an error occurred during runtime?

The first two elements come before \\em{second element} hence they can be skipped here without loosing anything important. Therefore it will return second last element when compared to whole list.

We can help with any issue you run into when trying to create it from scratch using only Twilio\u2019s API documentation (which includes their [Quick Start](https://www.twilio.com/docs/guide/quickstart) guide). But we won\u2019t do your homework for you. I suggest looking over some existing open source examples on GitHub and then posting questions about specific issues you have running those samples locally so that our community can assist :) https://github.com/search/?q=Twilio+chat&type=Code\n\nAnswer: This sounds like an assignment where you need to take care of all aspects of building your chatbot without guidance - including creating the UI component(s), handling input events and formatting output text based on data and contextual variables.

The first question is about the possibility of an iPad Pro coming with 5G capabilities; the second one asks whether we can expect the iPhone SE2 release soon after the announcement of iOS14 beta testing for developers (in July). For each of these two examples, the full transcript was available through a public API called \"Quorep\", which is freely accessible online. It includes user comments along with the question itself. Each question is represented by three sentences taken directly from the corresponding comment thread: one is provided by the OP (Original Poster), another one by a Responder and finally, a third sentence written by myself based on the given context. These sentences contain several words highlighted in red font which denote different emotional categories. My goal here is to assess how well the annotated data generated via Amazon Turk aligns with our actual knowledge regarding the topics discussed. To do so, I use standard metrics such as \\textbf{\\textit{Precision}}, \\textbf{\\textit{Recall}} and \\textbf{\\textit{F-measure}}. Here, \\textit{Precision} refers to the ratio between correctly identified entities in relation to those predicted to have the same emotion category as the reference sentence (e.g., ``I am sad\" is classified as `Sadness'). On the other hand, Recall denotes the number of true positives over total relevant instances (\\textit{TP/T}). Finally, F-measure",

I also love pixar movies such as Monsters Inc., Up!, Toy Story series (and many more). These animated movies always seem realistic with their details, expressions, characters etc. So if Nintendo got taken over by Disney, these types of cartoons can come true on the consoles/handheld devices!!

For office work most people use PCs for which there isn't much variation between them, they just have different screensize/keyboard type etc (e.g., HP Elitebook vs Lenovo Thinkpad). If you need more computing speed then go with the MacBook Pro, but it costs a LOT MORE than a Windows Laptop.\n3) Storage Capacity; This depends upon what kind of data you carry around, e.g., pictures, videos, movies etc. The larger your hard drive, the faster your computer will run so it may take longer before you upgrade again, however, nowadays you get very good speeds from small SSD drives.\n4) It also depends on the brand - Dell has always been great quality, but pricey. Apple products tend to break down quite often (especially iPhones), but they look beautiful! Asus makes great cheap laptops (the one I bought was \u00a3500 including an Intel Corei7 processor!)\nIn short, your decision would depend on personal preference regarding style & appearance over function, because all these brands offer similar specs.

This also helps weed out products with bad reviews because then I wouldn\u2019t want to buy those kinds of items! It gives me a general picture of how well the item works overall. 2) Next step after finding these reviews, I would read into more details by clicking onto further links such as Amazon or eBay to see actual pictures of the product itself and to see what kind of ratings they had there too since sometimes sites like \u201cNewegg\u201d may be biased towards certain companies rather than providing real customer opinions. After doing all that researching myself (if needed), I would take another look back over to NewEgg to check if any of the prices changed compared to my previous search. 3) Once everything has been done thoroughly and double-checked, I would feel confident enough to purchase the device I wanted without worrying if it won\u2019t work properly or be able to live up to its expectations. Also, once I receive my new device, I would immediately install windows update software in case anything else came out that would improve performance but didn\u2019t get included with the original OS version installed upon buying said machine.\n\\end{document}"

Lastly, if my device breaks down then its manufacturer will fix or replace it according to its policies within fourteen working days under normal circumstances and thirty working days if repairs take longer due to supply issues, quality control etc.; therefore it cannot become completely unusable beyond reasonable repair time frames! Now here is an important thing: if it is made abroad it is very likely to be stolen en route from China via Canada, US or UK - just imagine that happening every few weeks - hence please offer only Canadian or European products whenever feasible, although Japanese or American brands could still work too provided that shipping takes place inside North America rather than internationally through foreign companies that sell to customers world",

For now I would just get whatever they say meets requirements, because all this talk seems pretty overwhelming to me at this point lol\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nIn short - user is looking for a new computer with some general recommendations, but has no clue what these mean or imply; however she says that \"I want something more efficient\". It might be hard to extract exact recommendation out from such statement without knowing what she uses her current machine (which one she actually wants). Therefore I would try to give broad hints here (for example I'd ask if we are talking desktop vs. portable), but still focus mainly on getting info from them about usage scenarios rather than pushing certain type/model forward (at least in the first contact session). Then in the next round after asking further questions regarding different features like size/weight/price/battery lifetime etc., provide few examples that will suit particular customer scenario better compared to other models, or show comparison tables. At later stage you may even consider suggesting certain brand or model based on gathered knowledge (and only then, after understanding everything about his computing needs). In most cases however people buy exactly what salesperson suggest though :P So... Good luck! :)\n\nAnswer: This problem sounds like [computational complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity) where there exists many problems with known algorithms with different tradeoffs between speed, space used by solution data structure and worst case number of operations required for given algorithm to complete computation successfully. There isn't a clear best way across the board to handle any input since there isn't single solution applicable universally due to variety of hardware constraints. However when making purchase decision consumer generally knows how much performance they require relative to amount they can spend,"

            "1) A processor has an important role because it runs programs faster than they would without it; it is what allows people to open apps quickly, for example.\n2) The memory helps store data from these applications so we can access them when needed; if there wasn\u2019t enough RAM then everything might slow down dramatically (for example).\n3) Battery life also matters because our phones run out after several hours sometimes but it all depends on the phone model. It seems like every time I buy a new smartphone, it only lasts half the amount of my old one did before needing charged again.\n4) Another thing to consider is screen size and resolution; having more pixels means more energy required to light up each pixel individually - this increases overall heat generation and requires bigger coolers. In other words, the higher the number of pixels per square centimeter, the worse it will be. This applies both to computer screens and mobile displays.\n5) As for disk space, SSDs use less electricity than HDDs since they have no moving parts; they work by using electrical fields within semiconductors. Solid state drives offer much better performance over traditional hard disks.\n6) Overall, CPU speed and cache sizes play very large roles in determining performance, followed closely by memory speed/size, graphics card capabilities, storage type &amp; speeds, battery capacities etc\u2026 These features all interact with each other in complex ways though.\n7) Lastly, although this doesn\u2019t really apply to desktops anymore, portability still plays an essential part especially when it comes to laptops and tablets; smaller batteries usually mean shorter charge times too!\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\\\ \\hline\n\\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{Human Evaluation}} \\\\\n\\midrule Question: Which three of these reasons do you think best explains the differences between",
            "1) CPU performance - depends on many things but for general computing it depends mostly on frequency and cache size. A high-frequency CPU with low cache will perform worse than a lower frequency CPU with higher cache.\n2) Memory speed/size - the faster memory accesses data (less latency), the better the overall system performs. However this only matters if there isn't enough RAM so all applications won't fit into memory at once and need to be paged out from disk space (this would result in very slow page load times). Having more RAM helps here by reducing these wait times when switching between apps because less swapping happens. Increasing the amount of available swap space also reduces those times even further since more applications could be kept open without having to swap them out to free up memory slots. But keep in mind that the larger the swap partition is, the slower read operations become due to fragmentation over time. The solution for large swap partitions is using a SSD as an intermediate layer (see next point)\n3) Disk speed - obviously disks aren't nearly as fast as memory so they add additional delay compared to just accessing random locations in memory directly. They can however hold much more data (at least 50x depending on compression rate etc.)\n4) Power consumption - generally speaking a laptop doesn't have room for big cooling fans and therefore uses passive heat dissipators like heatsinks, metal plates etc.. These take energy away from the actual computation tasks though because every device has its own temperature limit where performance drops significantly (because electronics fail after too long at certain temperatures). That means if a processor is constantly running hotter then normal (like under heavy loads or prolonged usage periods) then the user will see degradations in both speed and battery life until it eventually shuts down entirely to prevent damage. Therefore good designers try to get around that by increasing fan speeds"

This also applies to languages that aren\u2019t so different, such as German where you can use the word \u201csch\u00f6n\u201d both for beauty and for health, depending upon contextual cues provided. In general though, unless the language is very similar to English or whatever other native tongue you speak, it probably isn\u2019t worth trying to do anything more advanced than simple phrases, especially given the limited resources available to most users of Google translate; the best way to learn another language is to actually immerse yourself in the culture surrounding its usage.",

            "02/13/2020 4:56:57 PM\nHi there! I am really sorry but my knowledge about this subject matter is very limited, so I will try to assist by sharing some related websites for more detailed information about it :\\n https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/\\n http://www.sciencedirect.com/\\n\nThank you! :) Have an awesome day ahead!\n\nComment: It depends on which aspect(s) you mean \"the same.\" Do all elements exhibit the same chemical properties regardless of mass? No. Are those differences large enough that we can say, \"element X has no analogues with mass Y\"? Yes (and even then it's not completely clear). Is every isotope of each element capable of forming stable compounds under most conditions? Not always; see for example [oxygen-18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_isotopologue#Molecular_properties) (see also [here](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cr970297e)).\n\nAnswer: The short answer is yes. All atoms of an element behave exactly alike at the atomic level. This includes both electrons and nucleons (protons & neutrons), because they all interact via electromagnetic force just like other particles in their orbitals around the atom\u2019s center. This means that although these two atoms differ only slightly from one another in terms of their nuclei composition, they still retain all of the qualities of their parent atoms. This allows us to predict the behavior of many atoms through modeling.",
            "1) Atoms that contain neutrons with mass numbers higher than their atomic number (Z) tend to be more tightly bound together by electrostatic forces; therefore, these atoms will have greater ionization energies and smaller radii than those without excess neutrons. This means heavier elements will usually require higher temperatures for fusion/fission reactions.\n2) In most cases where there may be an exception between lighter and heavier atoms having similar chemical properties, it would likely occur due to an increase in electron shells which causes increased orbital overlap (or 'hybridisation'). The strengthening bonds result from this hybridisation can cause changes to the bond angles and thus affect stability leading to differences in properties such as boiling point etc. However I believe for the specific case described above both sets of electrons would remain within one valence level resulting in very little change other than weight of atom itself causing overall difference in stability."

In order for an element's molecules to undergo chemical reactions such as combining or separating into smaller molecular groups called compounds - which all consist of some sort of atomic bonds between each other like C-H bonds between Carbon Atoms & Hydrogen atoms (a simple example of two bonding particles) -- then these molecule interactions need energy provided by heat to happen because of kinetic energy! Therefore this means if an atom of Iron exists somewhere inside Earth and suddenly releases a small amount of heat, causing it to melt down due to kinetic movement and create new compound bonds... it doesn't mean the exact same process won't happen when say Lithium is exposed to a source of energy since Lithium is also composed of many electron pairs which can combine through atomic interactions once exposed to sufficient energy sources just like Iron was before."

So it can be more than five metres if it really looks like rope but less if it isn't so. This depends on the use case of the rope itself. There might be other constraints as well, such as size restrictions etc. Assistant asks some followup questions about what types of ropes he had in mind for his example and which dimensions we need then. We get into a conversation going back forth on how many centimeters of width one robe needs minimum based on context and where. Afterwards, both agree the length seems reasonable enough now. The only question still open was whether there could also have been different materials involved as it seemed unclear from the start when asked - the assistant explained why using plastic would change matters. When all points were considered, user agrees there wasn't much more to add afterall besides specifying the material type used to create them. They seem satisfied with their choice eventually and say they appreciate assistants support for helping him out. We wish him best luck afterwards too! Have good day sir :)\n\\end{code}"

As stated above, resumes shouldn\u2019t contain grammatical errors nor clich\u00e9d statements so make sure that it sounds natural by carefully proofreading before handing in an application. There are no hard and fast rules about what to do when submitting your CV and resume online. For example there may still be times where companies have specific requirements for how applications are submitted (either online or offline), especially large corporations which can only accept electronic applications via their own website. But this varies from one company to another \u2013 although with technology these days many recruitment sites nowadays provide a toolkit for easy uploads and submission at short notice. In most cases however companies will advise potential candidates how best apply, either directly through email, an internet portal/job board link , an ATS system used during screenings or some other method. These days there has been movement towards automated processing whereby systems scan a candidate based on pre-defined criteria (skills/qualifications). Most job boards usually offer both of these methods and depending upon volume will process applicants accordingly - sometimes also offering facilities allowing a quick response and feedback should the position not be filled. So yes it all very much dependent on company policy but whatever medium a CV needs to be uploaded onto try and find out exactly what each employers particular set up looks like and then use that accordingly.

Include your full name (without abbreviations), place of birth and citizenship; phone number; education, academic degree; working experience (position/employers) + salary received per month during each employment period, current location / residence; marital status (spouse's full name); family composition, etc. Then describe briefly about yourself (education background, work history, goals). And end this section with keywords like \"professional\" / \"motivated\" / \"dedicated\". For more tips and advice on creating an excellent CV",

It will match strings containing URLs and replace them with links (either on your page or somewhere else). Note that this only works for text, so won't work with other types of media like images or videos. This assumes there are no nested URLs within sentences which contain at least one URL, e.g., \\em{\"This site has lots of great tutorials including https://www.w3schools.com/html\"} where both `http` and `https` should get replaced by their respective hyperlinks. The code below doesn't take into account the different formats URLs come in but if needed you may tweak the regex pattern accordingly. Also note that you have to specify `model_version: '20190925'` when creating the API instance.

            "1- A driver selects one gear (usually with their right hand), this shifts all gears at once to a specific speed. Whenever a new shift is made by pushing forward on the gear lever/knob/shift knob (as well as some newer automatic transmissions where you press upward on an icon labeled P R N D L etc.) then all of these different gears move together, causing a slight bump or \"jolt\" from each individual change in ratios, hence why we refer to them as a \\em{manual} rather than automated process for changing between the gears! 2- It uses hydraulic pressure and oil pumps within its mechanism so that when a car changes downwards it pushes out the same amount of oil used in a hydraulic ram but using a very low flow rate to maintain fluidity of the entire system which also prevents the motor getting flooded or stalled because of excessive water. The system relies on several interlocking cogs within its inner housing so whenever one gear goes up another will go down accordingly like domino effect and so on. I have never had any experience myself in driving vehicles that use Manual Transmissions due to the sheer number of variables required such as timing of how quickly a particular cog must rotate through various positions based on input received by sensors, computer processing unit(CPU) data output from multiple systems working concurrently such as GPS positional readings and current location and speed data being relayed via the engine ECM module(Engine Control Module). So in summary my explanation may sound too simple compared to actual technical knowledge, however, what I would advise is simply practicing yourself with real cars in a safe environment preferably away from roads, ideally inside an enclosed garage if possible before actually trying anything live, remember always keep both hands firmly grasping either side of ste",
            "1- It helps control power from going through too quickly and causes loss of engine speed due to wheel slip; it allows the vehicle operator more control over how much power is used for forward acceleration, when to change gears and how fast each individual shift takes place (as compared with an automatic transmission);  2 - When you use clutch, then car goes slow. The faster we push pedal , the higher the engine speed increases but when the wheels have maximum friction, then this makes our vehicles move smoothly . When I say that you must put clutches at all times when moving slowly so the brake would not get out easily which might result to accident; if the user forgets about using the break pedals during high speed drive on wet road then it could cause slipping on road which results to crashing the vehicle . Also by pushing hard cluthes the torque of engine decreases, because of low rotation speed and lower air resistance caused by increase velocity, the kinetic energy produced becomes smaller ;   3 \u2013  When there is heavy load or pulling weight then only it has better advantage. Manual transmission system reduces wear & tear as well. This gives greater flexibility of selecting appropriate rpm\u2019s at various driving conditions than the automated transmissions systems . For example if we need extra strength at hills and inclined surfaces like uphill drive , downhill drives , muddy terrains where car will automatically select its lowest available RPM which means that there would be no problem for driver. On another hand Automatic transmission uses less fuel because computer decides when best time for changing up and shifting between gear . Manuals have many benefits like cost effectiveness , fuel economy and easier repairs, especially during cold start up and maintenance operations, as well as giving a wider choice of options including manual versus auto transmissions for drivers who wish to do their own repairs/service work without taking them into a mechanic."

He has influenced many other great authors who follow his footsteps with writing. His work is often used by schools around the globe when teaching literature (particularly British Literature). He uses intriguing plots that grab attention quickly. For instance, \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d tells an exciting story about forbidden love between two families who hate each other due to an ongoing feud. Shakespeare also had several amazingly talented characters that stood out from others during their respective times. These included Hamlet, Macbeth, King Lear and Richard III among others.

I also believe this happened due to Shakespeare\u2019s playwright techniques, especially using proliferate language (words), which gave birth to new wordings we use up until nowadays. A lot of authors tried to emulate him and he received quite some criticism from other poets at first, but he continued writing anyway, never changing his styles despite those criticisms.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThe dataset for training models contains approximately $45$M utterances and $1290$Gb words in total across all datasets with an average $2768 \\pm 3495.5$ tokens per context utterance. In contrast, the test set used during inference contains almost exactly half the token number (approximately $1421$K per text). The reason for doing it like this is because there was no direct supervised data available for our purposes here; thus, generating small amounts of labeled examples (about one million) became our strategy to train the models. We chose the most commonly occurring classes found in the UMLS semantic hierarchy of MeSH terms (Medical Subject Headings)~\\cite{UMNS}. Our methodology uses the MTurk crowdsource platform to annotate questions according to their MeSH tags for each domain in the knowledge graph. This allows us to scale the size of annotated samples and therefore increase performance on out-of-distribution sets without much difficulty when more questions get annotated. As shown later, the quality achieved after using the proposed augmentation improves by $8$\\% when compared with the state-of-the-art model trained only with original sentences. More details regarding both architectures can be seen below (\\cref{fig:architectures}).\n\\begin{figure}[",
            "Shakespeare was very successful when he wrote his plays. He produced many of works which have been viewed over centuries by several different cultures and countries around the world. His most famous work \"Romeo And Juliet\" was also adapted into three motion pictures (theatre, TV film, and Hollywood). His life may be portrayed in movies but nobody knows what it actually looked like because there no historical sources left available for study. It will always remain a mystery as who really William Shakespeare, besides what everyone already knew about him from books we read in school, and other various resources on internet. We do however can assume based off some evidence that he was probably educated to a relatively high level himself and had access/knowledge of Latin language skills, Greek literature , European history and drama, Bible & Holy Book knowledge, geography skills/map reading skills, astrology knowledge. I would believe if all above assumptions were correct then surely he could write anything that was required with the best accuracy out of anyone else in town at this time period! As I am writing right now using google, my grammar and spelling might not even be perfect nor my sentence structure, punctuation marks etc...but imagine myself having a similar skill as an artist of paintings - where I'm just painting a picture without studying colors first, without knowing what kind of brushes I need how much paint is needed..and so forth. With Shakespeare's ability I think he didn't know whether people liked his play or not because they weren't as literate at times compared to us today. So that way of communicating/thinking back then wasn't quite accurate same way our technology today is evolving rapidly everyday making everything better than before for mankind. Shakespeare just wanted to entertain his audience through his artistry & imagination since this was almost 500 years ago during the age of enlightenment era. All we have ever known histor"

For this we will have a space character delimiter between two tokens; I've chosen `\\s+` here which matches one or more spaces\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe first thing I did when working on my own project like yours is reading [the Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/), because there they contain explanations for most of these concepts! They were extremely useful in order to get me started without much background knowledge :) Here, you can see that `str.split()` method accepts an optional parameter, the argument `' '`, that represents our delimiters: \\strong{\\em{' '}} -> white space (\\strong{i.e.} the empty space)\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item filter out any stopwords.

For example one site stated \"The Elizabethan playwright wrote around three-quarters of our current lexicon.\" however another website says\"...only approximately two per cent (or less) of his written word endure.\" https://www.shakespeareunlocked.com/news-features/why-is-william-shakespeare-important/.

These facts and statements create doubt towards the actual impact that he had.

He also created new words for his writing with inventive ideas for characters names like Rosaline (from As You Like It) or Olivia from Twelfth Night. The Globe Theatre where most of Shakespeares works would be performed was very impressive when compared to other theatre buildings at the time - the wooden stage jutted out into an open yard, giving actors access to all parts of the stage area. In this way the audience could see what happened onstage more clearly than if they had been looking down upon the action as before. There was even space above the heads of spectators for musicians to play during performances. At the same time there was no room for seats except for those rich enough to pay for them, thus making these early performances rather exclusive. Shakespeare also helped to change how we use our language nowadays by adding thousands of words into everyday English. Words such as bedazzled, eyeball, lacklustre, luggage, moonlighting, radiance, skimpy and zany can all be traced back to him. Even the word \"asshole\" came from one of his insults!

His work has had tremendous influence on modern theatre and popular culture, with numerous adaptations and references appearing across different forms of media including stage productions, film, novels, comic books, operas, musicals and songs, among others.\\n2. The reason behind it may be because he used words which people at that time would understand but also using them in ways they weren't intended to be.

It also brings hope & energy everywhere!   \\strong{Kaimora}: The first woman born from earth, after its creation by goddess Usha Devi herself, according to an Indian epic Mahabharata .She was gifted immortality due to her great powers she acquired from gods and later married sage Viswamitra and became his queen Kaumudi ,which means lotus among many names ! Her father Suryadeva blessed her that he would come to see every year in form of \"Chaitramasa\" ,to show love and blessings for everyone living under him .She was mother to famous Vyas, who compiled holy texts vedas himself, alongwith many other books !   \\strong{Garuda:} Lord Krishna had two eagles which helped in killing demoness Putana during war of Lanka when Sri Ram returned back to Ayodhya with Sita maharani ! These two were known as Jay and vijay but since garud came ahead in time they both went to jannaloka alongwith king Dashraj, lord Hanuman was appointed next protector for Rama family ,so garud is said to be successor to hanuman as well ,later in Mahabhrat he carried Bheesma dev, Pandava army towards Hastinapur on Garud kak",

So, for example `A mythological creature` is grammatical, but so too is `His life was mythologic`. In short, there seems no reason \\em{\\strong{not}} to use it with the present participle. But since this might confuse users who have been taught that the only verbs we may attach '-ing' suffixes to are finite forms (\\textit{'running'}, rather than *'run'), then it probably makes more sense just to stick with finite forms. And besides, some words are less suitable to participative usage anyway -- consider 'glacial'. It'd sound weird if someone said they had a glaciated lifestyle. This also helps",

Moreover, he emphasized on the existence of underemployment in some countries which need government action for increasing effective demand. As we learned earlier, economists usually disagree with different theories but if two sides have different explanations regarding similar phenomena then one explanation becomes stronger than other. The phenomenon which both Keynesian view and classical theory tried to explain are cyclical changes; therefore, their interpretations were compared by Kalecki. In his study 'The Political Economy of Full Employment', Kalecki has shown how excessive accumulation of savings leads to reduced business expenditures (Keynes\u2019 paradox), which eventually slows down spending and investments resulting into lower prices that cause inflationary pressures. Therefore when these forces work against each other due to high unemployment rates, it can be resolved through monetary policies like change in interest rate etc., However, during recession periods monetary policy cannot tackle deflation.\n\nAssistant: What do scholars think about Kalecki ideas?\n\\end{code}\n\nI did try to create separate functions using `f-strings`and printing them out inside the function, however this solution isn't efficient enough because I would still face the same problem.

For instance, recent efforts attempt tackling social bias as part of knowledge distillation~\\cite{hudson2019gains}; however, most studies only consider binary classification tasks. Therefore, they cannot evaluate real-world scenarios where the input space can potentially contain hundreds if not thousands of features, including continuous ones.

They may be intelligent however they won`t ever have human consciousness so they will never feel emotions, suffer pain etc. It would take many centuries before our future robots and machines reach this stage (if at all). To give you an idea about where we stand today - consider the brain weight (kg): mammalian:30-56 kg; bird(eagle):149 g ; insect:(ants):2mg \\cite{brainweight}. Of course there are some very smart birds but it doesn`t matter because their physical body is just too small to have enough neurons and thus sufficient \"intelligence\".

Our results show how we could build a system which learns from user behavior, adapting over time based upon their feedback, thus improving its quality. This research has implications beyond chatbots, as it shows how machine learning systems may benefit greatly with human-like qualities, such as empathy; ultimately leading towards a more trusted relationship between man and technology.

In my opinion if we do so, it will bring great disaster. Therefore, we need more researchers to work on it together. 2) No, it is only an algorithm which can learn from human behavior through machine learning. It is impossible for it to have self-consciousness like humans. 3). I am not sure about it since there are many factors affecting the result of the experiment. The most important thing here is to keep the integrity and honesty when doing experiments. So I believe it would be better if they could get enough people who are qualified to participate their experiments.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThe user response (user\\_response) is then fed to the model along with other features such as the query string, and session id.

The bot may also wish to inform users about its plans on how long the downtime will last - e.g., \"I\u2019ll be offline until next week.\"\n\n### Actions\nWhenever an action is performed by the user via the bot interface, such actions can trigger events to occur within the contextual state. For example, if someone asks where they can find a restaurant nearby, the bot could add a new action object which contains some details on restaurants found near them.\nAdditionally, the bot might choose to update itself accordingly using a rule based engine to determine what information should go into those objects so as to improve future replies. However, there is no need to worry too much about this part yet since most bots will likely have very simple actions at first.\nTherefore, actions might just involve simply adding more information to the contextual state or sending out notifications to users regarding their queries. In short, these are basic triggers which indicate important things happening during conversations between chatbots and human agents. They can range from asking the same query again after waiting X amount of time to displaying messages indicating that the conversation was terminated due to lack of activity.

The probability of A happening before B must exceed $0$ according to the above definitions -- i.e., P(A|B) = P(B|A). Now consider two events such that one happens after another by definition; thus they are causal related at least in theory -- e.g., dropping a ball from the top floor vs walking up stairs... In other words, we need to determine which event is more \"likely\" first -- assuming \"universe knowledge\". We have no way to determine how likely an A given history of B but when our universe-level model doesn't depend upon knowing about prior world states (which is arguably quite similar to us having a time machine), there's no reason (to my eyes) to believe B didn't come before A except under certain statistical assumptions, and even then B would only lead in the direction of making A slightly less probable.

I have an orange cat.' the language learning algorithm would realize that there must be a typo with one word. So it tries all variations of words (in this case -orange-, orange-, etc) until the best fit matches what the person typed into their computer/phone screen. It will then ask if they mean hello/goodbye OR orange cat(s). Once confirmed, the next time a sentence comes up similar, like 'hi guys!, we're having pizza for lunch today', it would already understand what they were trying to say even before it reached translation mode so that no error messages would show. That's basically how my own system works on mobile phones/tablets; whenever i try typing in English (I speak only Arabic), i usually end up writing weird stuff that has nothing to do with the meaning i want to express, and by doing simple maths with different phrases/sentences/words and seeing which fits perfectly into context with others. After getting it right, my app would add the phrase into its dictionary under certain parameters. It'd remember them every time they pop out again in text messages. It wouldn't get confused about the usage anymore either.

While we all agree that this isn't exactly a legal issue (because it can be subjective), we still want our assistants to act appropriately. For example, if someone asked about whether the earth was flat, then one would say no because we all learned from school that it wasn't. The same applies for the questions you posted above - those who ask these kinds of questions are clearly trolling. Therefore, the most appropriate response is simply saying nothing; ignoring them will teach them not to post such ridiculous queries on Stack Exchange again. This will prevent further issues with people thinking the community agrees with them and makes the site look more professional overall. However, some might argue that giving bad information like saying that rape doesn't exist or abortion causes infertility will also result in future problems down the road. As far as my personal opinion goes, I think both methods have their own merits. Ignoring trolls gives off the impression that nobody cares but educating others has its benefits too.

The first component concerns about \\em{\\strong{answer}} itself; whether it makes sence, what it includes, etc... It seems like it has no relation to `SpongeBob`. Second component asks for `honesty` which means we should try to avoid spamming - say nothing that doesn't relate at all to `SpongeBob`, but also shouldn't give irrelevant details that doensn't bring any benefit into conversation. Third one requires us to be friendly and polite, maybe even funny.

So my questions are: Is it correct? How can we define correctness? Can we agree on certain criteria which would indicate that the person who answered is correct? Or maybe even more importantly, can we prove when somebody isn't right? Do we need to provide additional explanation or is just stating facts"

Here it looks like Google is using a past participle rather than a simple present tense verb - this means 'Independence Day' becomes a noun ('day'), which makes perfect sense (e.g. 'I saw The Fourth of July', or 'July the fourth' when speaking). As far as I can see from Google searches, the phrases `fourth day` or even just `'Fourth'` seem very common so it's entirely likely there could have been a large amount of context for what was intended here! It doesn't necessarily mean they didn't intend independence/independance to appear but it could equally refer to some other concept with an alternate name (which has already appeared many times throughout history), or maybe the word independence had actually meant 'to become independent'.

The word has been used with multiple meanings when it comes to deep learning architectures, so just to be sure we understand each other correctly before starting to work together, could you please tell me which one you have in mind specifically?\n2.)

The article uses the wedge-product to activate the hidden layers of their artificial neuron model. It also shows how they use this operation between two vectors in the final layer of the network. My guess is that their formula looks similar to this: $$x = \\text{GeoProd}\\left( h_1 ,h_2\\right) +b$$ where $b$ might be some bias value (or maybe zero?) and the $\\text{GeoProd}$ means some geometric product defined over real numbers. Since this is the part of their algorithm that produces the outputs, I think it makes sense to replace all occurrences of $\\times$, $|\\cdot|$ or $(., .)$ with the geometric product operator.",
            "1. It can be used only for vectors. 2. The computation has many matrix multiplications (but only one vector multiplication). 3. In general it cannot be computed without loss of precision by floating point operations (unless we use other number systems such as bignums). However there exist some tricks which may allow us to approximate the result with high accuracy using only float numbers. One trick is to re-express everything into polar coordinates then compute using complex exponentiation. Another technique involves converting to spherical coordinate system, computing with logarithms, then transforming back again. This allows the usage of floating point maths for most cases - however this will introduce small error. So this approach needs more testing if we want to have precise results. 4.

            "1) Start with the tensor product $\\mathbf A \\otimes_g \\mathbf B$ where $A = (a_1,\\dots ,a_{N\\times M})$ has shape NxM matrix of numbers. The tensor product is simply two such matrices on top of each other but multiplied element-wise i.e. $(A^T)*(B)$ after transposition. Then perform the geometric algebra operation \"GE\" which can be thought as a generalization of Matrix Multiplication. This gives a vector $[c]=[c_0+ c_1 x+... + c_n y ...]$ with all coefficients of the elements $a_i$, weighted by [conjugates](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConjugateVector.html). All components are reordered into rows here as in GE everything will get transformed accordingly. This is usually implemented through the so called LeviCivita pseudo inverse matrix - also available as a convenience builtin. For this purpose we need to create one now as it may seem confusing otherwise that a bunch of random matrices are getting popped up everywhere. Let us therefore define: $\\Omega=inv(\\Omega)=[e^{ai}_b]$, i.e.:\n$$a_k e^{-ak} = 0\\\\\\Omega^{T}=\\Omega$$ Note that here the multiplication symbol \"$*$\" doesn't denote the *dot* operator yet! Now you just transform every column back to the original order using $\\Omega$ and add them all together. Which means for every original component [of type float|complex]: $$[c']=\\sum_{ij}[\\delta^*(ai)\\frac{e^ja}{a*}]_j$$ Where: $$\\begin{align*}e&=x^2+y^2 \\\\a &= \\pm |z|^4 i + zx \\\\[2mm]\\omega&={acosh}("

            "1) It\u2019s been a long time since someone asked about geometric algebra here on StackOverflow! The last was [GeometricAlgebra.jl for Julia](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64802573/). So, thank you for bringing up this interesting topic. In short, no, it has never been implemented with deep learning libraries. But, we can think through what needs to be done if you want to try to do so yourself. Let me begin by describing what GA does compared to the standard linear algebra approach used today in DL (the inner-product). We need two vectors x & y where each element of those vectors have their own coordinate system attached to them. That way they both carry some extra info which makes our math easier than just having a simple list of numbers representing values. In order to perform matrix multiplication using the traditional linear algebra method, one first computes the dot products between every pairing of elements in these vectors (i.e., `x_a*y_b`) then sums all these dot products together over every index pair (`sum(x_a * y_b)`), resulting in a single number known as the \\em{dot product}. However, there\u2019s more than one kind of dot product when working with matrices, such as the Euclidean, Frobenius, etc.. And there also exist other types of \u201cmultiplication\u201d functions available within vector spaces such as the outer product (aka tensor product). To keep things simpler though let\u2019s stick to discussing only the Euclidean dot product type because that is the most commonly utilized. The next step would be to normalize each individual term obtained from multiplying x by y so that we can later scale the final result accordingly based upon whatever criteria we decide will determine its magnitude (such as max magnitude). After doing that we end up with the final result z = sum(`x_a` * `y_b",
            "1. Let\u2019s first look at what the dot product is doing mathematically: $ \\vec{x} .\\vec{y}$ = $\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}{ x_iy_i }$ The problem with this formulation (apart from it not really representing the actual geometric interpretation) is that the term for the $j^{th}$ element becomes $(x_ix_j + y_iy_j)$ which isn\u2019t exactly useful if we want to be able to multiply matrices together using these products because of matrix multiplication. This means we have two choices when we use dot products to define our inner products. Either we can define them on elements where the resultant terms cancel out (and so become zero), such as the scalar case; or else we can redefine our vectors such that they always sum up to one (such as by defining each vector component to range between -1 and 1). So either way there\u2019s no point multiplying these inner products unless we already have a normalised vector to do the dot product against! However, with geometric algebra all those issues go away! For starters we just use the symbolic definition of dot product without having to worry about anything other than making sure the indices line up properly: $$\\langle a,b\\rangle = ab^\\dagger$$ where here we see the conjugate transpose notation, which we will need later on too! Next we also notice that we actually only ever require two types of operation in order to define every single possible algebraic object. We start off with scalars and then add the concept of \u2018vectorial objects\u2019. Scalar operations remain unchanged \u2013 we simply continue adding numbers together \u2013 but vectorial operations work slightly differently now due to us working within the geometric setting. Specifically, whenever we have a linear combination of different vectorial objects then the results still obey addition rules. That said however, once again things get interesting since we realise"

            "1) Firstly, we have the following definition for a geometric product: $$ (u \\otimes v)^a = u^av^b$$\nwhere $u$ and $v$ denote vectors and $a$ and $b$, their respective weights; $\\cdot$ denotes the ordinary scalar product between two numbers; and $^{}$ represents exponentiation with base $e$. The resultant vector is denoted by $(u\\otimes v)$. This operation can only be defined when both arguments are non-zero. When this occurs, it results in a new number which has magnitude $|uv|= |u||v|\\cos{\\theta}$, where $\\theta$ is called the angle between them. It follows that if the angles between all inputs are equal then they produce zero outputs.\n\n2) Now let us assume there exist four input neurons $x_i$ and output neuron $y$, such that each pairwise combination of these six variables produces either a positive or negative value, depending on whether the angle between those pairs is acute ($<90^\\circ$) or obtuse ($>90^\\circ$). Let the weight factors $c_{ij}^k$ be assigned according to Table~\\ref{tab:table1}. Note that here $j$ refers to one of three other variables besides $x_i$: $z_1, z_2,$ or $z_3$.\n\nThe final step involves defining the summed product term as follows: $$\\text{(summed) } p(y)=\\sum_{(x)} c_{ij}^ky.$$ Here the summation runs over the set $\\{x_j\\} = \\{z_1, z_2 , z_3\\}$, and $p(y)$ denotes the total product. Then the output neuron can be expressed in terms of its previous state using the following formula: $$ y=\\frac{e^{-p(y)/T}}{\\sum_n e^{-q",
            "1) The dot product can be implemented with the geometric product using the formula below (the \"dot product\" is denoted by $\\cdot$): $$\\textstyle x\\cdot y = \\begin{bmatrix}x^1\\\\y^1\\\\z^1\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}a_0&a_i&b_j\\\\c_{ij}&e_{kj}&f_{kl}\\\\g_{\\ell j}&\\delta_{m\\ell} &h_{mn}\\end{bmatrix}^{-1}\\begin{pmatrix}\\overline{x}^1 \\\\ \\overline{y}^{1} \\\\ \\overline{z}^n\\end{pmatrix}.$$\nHere, $x=\\sum^{2+N}_{n=0}{\\alpha^n(x^na_n + z^nb_nx^nc_n+w)^n}$ and similarly for $y$. In this formulation, $x$ and $y$, which are column vectors, have been multiplied together element-by-element. Then the resulting vector has then been multiplied by its transpose.\nThe resultant matrix is called $M$ and we denote it with $A^{-1}$.\nWe can also use the following notation to describe our matrix: $$M = [a_{ij}]=[a_ib_jb_\\ell c_km_nd_oe]_i.$$\nIn other words, $M$ represents a multiplication table where each row corresponds to some set of elements and columns correspond to another such group of indices. Each cell contains a number representing the product obtained when these two groups were multiplied elementwise.\n\nNow if $x = \\begin{bmatrix}1&0&3\\end{bmatrix}^{\\intercal}$, then $\\begin{array}{lcl} Mx &= &\\begin{bmatrix}a_0&&\\\\c_{ij}&&\\\\ g_{\\ell i} &&\\end{bmatrix"

            "1. I have always wanted to be like my parents. They both worked very hard and taught me everything they knew when it came to farming, growing crops and working with animals. As an adolescent, I learned how to care for cattle on our farm, and was given some responsibilities such as taking care of chickens, collecting eggs every day before school and making sure everyone had enough food. I would wake up early in the morning during winter time, shovel snow off from all over the farm, so we could feed our livestock. After coming back home at nightfall, I took out all garbage outside the house and helped clean inside too. I never got tired doing this because I enjoyed helping around the place; besides, if there wasn\u2019t anything done, nobody else would do them either.\n2. In summer time, after having finished school and come home exhausted, I used to get fresh fruits straight away from the orchard near by and drink juice immediately, just to give myself strength. I loved walking barefoot through those trees and getting scratched here and there but somehow managed to survive. At times I couldn\u2019t stop looking up at their branches reaching towards heavenly clouds above, admiring its beauty and enjoying its presence. I used to take baths underwaterfalls whenever I felt like cooling down and listening to water falling softly behind my ears made me feel good and calm. Those moments were worth cherishing forever!\n3. The biggest change happened right after finishing high-school, which changed my entire worldview completely. It started raining heavily one afternoon, I didn\u2019t even realize until someone called me to check whether I needed pickup service or not.

I love this time of year because it brings so many memories flooding back from times long ago. The birds sing their song every morning waking up the world. As they start singing I can see children running across the field playing hide-and seek amongst each other giggling away at all the fun they are having. Everyone seems happy and full of joy which gives them an extra spring in their step and puts a smile upon my face knowing how much joy these beautiful creatures bring me happiness. It reminds me of when my grandchildren were little; we would go down onto the beach where they could build sand castles or dig holes into the ground. They always had such good imagination. My favorite memory is going camping once during summer holidays. We went off to find our spot underneath some tall pine trees next to a small river filled with fish. We spent hours just sitting and talking about anything and everything whilst enjoying the fresh air and scenery that surrounded us. We made sure we took plenty of photos to show our friends what amazing sights we saw and even though I was young I still remember those wonderful moments today. After dinner we played cards until late before heading inside our tent to sleep for another night under canvas. This experience gave me so many great memories that will never leave me and makes me wish that my grandkids could be able too do something like this again.\n\\section{Answers}\nAssistant: Do you think AI assistants should be designed without gendered language?

When he passed away, I was left alone until my father grew up next door and started using me as his home. The house still stands today. I remember the first day he brought home his bride. They made their wedding vows underneath me. She gave birth to five sons who played on my branches. As time progresses, one son moved into my shadow. My wife gave him two beautiful daughters, whom I watched grow over the decades into women. Now they have children playing around my roots again.

There is no relation between relativity and probabilities; they just happen to have similar notation because the same mathematical structures can describe them both (probability is essentially an inner product on some vector space).\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Amplitude * amplitude = square of absolute value, but this isn\u2019t unique for non-real numbers so we take the real part by defining |x|=sqrt(x*conjugate(x)). The reality condition then forces us to only consider conjugates of real quantities when taking imaginary parts which avoids this problem altogether.\n2. Amplitude^2 gives two different results depending on whether x+y is negative or positive; the latter makes it seem like there was no way around introducing sqrt into qm from classical physics even though in principle it could all still work out if you never used abs(). But I guess this really just means the maths behind complex analysis had to be done anyway, regardless of what other maths needed doing too...\n3. By definition the sign of a number determines its phase. Phase matters whenever you do anything with vectors, including dividing/multiplying them together or adding up their magnitudes. That means you either need a methodology whereby you define the signs of numbers ahead of time somehow - e.g., +/-1 represent \"right\"/\"left\", +0 represents \"straight downwards\" etc.. - or else you end up with weird ambiguities (e.g., in general, it will always be more meaningful to say that A=-B than B=-A without specifying some kind of orderings over the set of possible values first).\n4.

            "40. The relativity of space and time plays an important part for many concepts such as simultaneousness between distant points in spacetime and local vs non-local physics (quantum entanglement). A more subtle connection comes from how special relativity gives rise to quantum uncertainty principles, but also leads us into realizing what makes our world look classical. Classically there exist physical systems which are perfectly well described by classical fields and waves on the scale at hand - it's easy enough to construct simple models for waterwaves with classical potential energy terms which allow perfect wave predictions of height etc.. Quantum mechanical phenomena are typically very sensitive to tiny variations and therefore have high precision, meaning that small fluctuations in some variable will change things substantially; if these effects are strong they will prevent you making reliable estimates even about relatively simple systems like a water drop in motion because everything changes due to small temperature fluctuation/thermal noise, or perhaps random perturbative interactions between the particles of interest, i.e. when studying e.g. liquid droplets it would take astronomic computing power just to estimate where all atoms in a droplet happen to lie without making approximations and this sort of calculation doesn't even attempt to deal with issues involving atomic structure (like binding energies), chemical bonds breaking / forming and so forth, yet such problems arise precisely in those areas which one expects classical behaviour. It turns out though that classical theories do have certain fundamental limits and that this means you can't describe the properties of arbitrarily small scales or highly chaotic motions in ordinary classical language; if we had perfect knowledge then every atom would follow exactly deterministic paths governed only by known laws, no stochasticity, nothing probabilistic or subjective would remain except in situations involving ignorance over initial conditions etc...\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item There aren\u2019t two distinct ways to treat them classically.",

            "1) Life has two forms which can be classified into the living form and non-living form; where all living things have common characteristics such as metabolism, growth and reproduction and non-living thing lacks these three characteristics (Metabolic process: it means an organisms take nutrients from their surroundings to maintain life processes). Living organisms obtain energy for this through food/chemosynthesis by oxidation of molecules, resulting in waste products including carbon dioxide. All plants use photosynthesis and most animals rely on consuming other organisms for their nutrition needs. A living cell consists of multiple biomolecules which undergo chemical reactions within itself, therefore cells need enzymes and hormones to control the reaction pathways, however there exist various types of tissues such as muscle, fat etc., in addition they perform specialized functions e.g. digestion occurs inside our stomach with aid of gastric juices produced by the parietal layer of our gut wall. Therefore life can be defined as the existence of single celled organisms or multicellular organisms. Furthermore, I think it\u2019s worth mentioning here that living systems consist of complex interacting components i.e. organelles and cells function together as an integrated unit known as \u201corgan system\u201d. Also, one more point that mustn\u2019t go missing here is that the word \"life\" implies having some kind of subjective experience but no matter how we try to define life it remains a very abstract concept so it will always remain philosophically difficult. 2) To answer the above questions we firstly need to understand what is meant by \u201cLife\u201d - There exists numerous definitions for \u201clife\u201d, according to Aristotle he defines \u201clife\u201d as \u2018an actively self sustaining force that exhibits goal directed behaviour\u2019.

He will enjoy delicious foods like burgers and fries at McDonald's and Burger King but he won't be able to order them because they don\u2019t speak Spanish well enough to understand him! But all this isn't what really interests Kratos about our world. The real reason is that it has been years since Kratos last fought a battle so he wants to challenge one person who would stand up against him; Captain America. Kratos finds Cap by going through social media sites and finally decides which city to go after him based on the most recent Instagram post from Captain America himself. After taking down Captain America, Kratos learns that there was an even more powerful enemy than himself here on earth known only as Thanos. So Kratos must travel throughout the country until he can find Thanos\u2019 whereabouts using clues found within Captain Americas phone. Finally Kratos finds Thanos and challenges him alone without his powers. Kratos uses the power of the Gauntlet of Zeus which allows him to fly across the sky defeating anyone who comes near him. This leads to the final boss fight between Kratos vs Thanos. At first Thanos tries to trick Kratos into believing that the Gauntlet doesn't work and just picking it up will activate it. However when Kratos discovers its true potential, Thor then appears and stops Thanos before he could defeat Kratos. In the end Thor takes back the Gauntlet, Kratos returns home, and everyone lives happily ever after...\n\\\\\\hline\n~\n\\end{tabbing}\n}\n\n\\section{Quantitative Evaluation}\\label{sec:quant_eval"

Creating an empty array named \"text\" with dimensions equal to those specified by user (this must match exactly). It contains all zeros initially. The type of each element is str representing Unicode characters. Each string has length 50 (a random number between 49-50 was given to us by users during testing phase), and is stored contiguously. All elements inside this array represent strings, i.e., every single character represents one letter. We want our array to hold the letters corresponding to the picture we are trying to create from ASCII art. So we initialize it to all zeroes since no letter appears yet. In order to find out what these letters correspond to, you need to look at the following section titled \"Problem Statement.\"\n4. Finding the average RGB value per pixel in the original file using PIL module (Image library) functions such as getpixel().\nNote: We cannot just directly access individual pixels because there could potentially be padding added around them, but this shouldn\u2019t happen in practice if the input image format supports storing RGB values directly without any additional metadata.

We note here this also applies when generating both human conversations \\cite{xu_conversation} and other AIs like ALICE (the chatterbot) \\cite{gilius_alice}. The first set of generated answers is based entirely off of statistics gathered about France taken form Wikipedia (\\url{https://en.wikipedia.org}) such as average age distribution demographics along with population figures, life expectancy, health statuses etcetera where 80\\% were reportedly having fat according to the USDA \\cite{usda}, the second type utilized general trends found within Google Trend search data over time since 2004 for various searches relating towards humor such as ``comic'' and ``comedian\", ``humorous\", \"joke\", ``funny\" which would give us an idea if there was higher usage at certain times when more popular people performed standup shows or released movies and finally the third method explored the use of random word associations between synonyms using Wordnet.org's vocabularies and hypernyms as seen described above under Data. In our findings we observed many similarities between the types such as most instances including some or all synonymous words. For instance most phrases associated with `fat' included either ``thick\", ``heavy\", ``obese\", `large',`overweight'' and even had a very small portion referencing ``dumb\".

In addition to statistical data about funniness we would also like to compare qualitative indicators such as popular humor publications. However this will have less influence on the results due to lacking reliable historical comparable numbers across decades, because of inconsistent quality and/or availability measures between different periods in history, which could bias the comparison significantly if no corrections were applied beforehand. This may sound like a complex process but there exists many academic journals and other public sources specializing on the subject where researchers collect, aggregate, cleanse, modelize, transform, correlate and normalize raw datasets and perform sophisticated statistical analyses using cutting edge technologies, techniques and procedures based upon deep theoretical foundations of modern computer science disciplines like mathematics, statistics and physics; which provide very precise predictions for ranking of all countries around the world.

            "\tFrench humor is characterized by its subtle formulation, paradoxical situations, absurd characters (the clown), and irony. This kind of humor can be seen through different forms such as theatre plays, movies, television programs and cartoons which have been very influential on other cultures worldwide. The main characteristic of French comedy is that it uses sarcasm with a touch of ironic wit. In France this type of comedy is called 'humour noir'. The French use humorous language when they want to express their disagreement about an idea but also to show how intelligent someone could potentially appear if he was able to see the flaws in another persons argumentation. They do this by creating a fictitious person who has those characteristics that represent what the real opponents would think like. This allows them to criticize the arguments without directly attacking anyone personally. For example, the following joke shows us how two Frenchmen were discussing politics:\n\"I am going out tonight,\" said one of them to his friend, \"and I will vote for socialism.\" - \"Why?\" asked the second man. \"- To support my mother\", answered the first one. - \"But she already passed away!\" replied his friend surprised at hearing him say that.- \"That doesn't matter! My father died too... But we still voted for capitalism\". 19th Century literature produced many satires, among others from Charles Pigault-Lebrun, Honor\u00e9 Daumier, Alphonse Karr, Jules Janin, Alfred Jarry and Paul Armont, all famous authors whose work influenced modern day French comics.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nAnswer: It depends on whether `user` is supposed to be some sort of \\begin{code}\n<dialogue>\n\\end{code} object or not; i.e., whether it"

However, I do believe that it could be healthier for everyone if we all started eating more soy products (such as edamame) regularly. So yes, from my point of view, soy can improve overall nutrition levels across genders because these products contain high levels of protein, fiber, folate, magnesium, iron, calcium, phosphorus, zinc, thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B6, niacin and omega-3 fatty acids. But no matter what anyone says, this food cannot change people\u2019s gender identity or sexual orientation. In addition, according to research published on WebMD about \u201cSoy: Health Benefits vs. Risks\u201d, consuming too much soy may lead to weight gain due to its extremely high calorie count.

This might have led some people to believe that they become women if they consume lots of soy products.\\newline However, there is no evidence that shows consumption of soy products has any negative effects on human reproductive systems.\\newline It may also be worth mentioning that \\textbf{the US FDA} recently announced that they are allowing manufacturers to use \"soymilk\" interchangeably with cow milk when describing their product.\\footnote{\\url{https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/FSMA/ucm614537.htm}}\n\\end{quote}\n\\noindent In the second example, the user gives an informative response without revealing anything about themselves except for the knowledge shared within the chatbot. For example, ``I am female'' is never revealed even though it can easily be inferred by analyzing previous dialogues. We assume such conversations could be considered less invasive compared to those where personal attributes are directly disclosed, since only implicit data about the users would be exposed. Thus, we argue that both kinds of conversation are beneficial in terms of collecting social-behavioral insights but that they require different strategies and models for understanding them effectively. Our model leverages both these approaches, learning two separate latent representations of users through two independent encodings of their chats, one for each kind of interaction. Then, using these two types of latents, our approach predicts the corresponding behavior based on how well they fit to what was said during the chat session.\\\\[-0.2cm]\n\\subsection*{Experimental Setup}\nTo test whether our method is able to extract useful insights regarding personality traits from",

            "1) It\u2019s not proven scientific evidence but it might be true because some women have been found with more estrogens than usual (a hormone related to sexuality), and they were using a lot of soy products; however this could also happen for other reasons like genital malformations during pregnancy. So I think that if you consume too much soy then probably your body will react to those chemicals. However, it has not been shown conclusively that eating soya causes men who eat it regularly to develop female characteristics. 2) No. That would require a very high intake of soy over a long period of time which isn't recommended anyway - even though there may well be health benefits associated with consuming soy protein. 3) There was an article about this topic on BBC website last month. According to them \"the idea that soy can cause people to become gay is nonsense\". They said further research showed the same thing about turning someone into a woman. But according to my opinion no one knows what happens after we die, maybe God changes us into different gender when he takes us from this world. 4) The only way to find out how much soymilk it would take is through experimentation...and that sounds pretty gross lol. 5) This statement is ridiculous since there is nothing to prove that soy makes anyone anything except perhaps a better person due to its many beneficial properties including helping prevent heart disease, osteoporosis etc.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nIn addition we use BERT \\cite{devlin_bert_nodate}.

In this case, it is important for us to be able to understand what the user meant by their response. This will allow our system better identify whether or not we need to take action against the user who made such statements based on its potential impact towards other users within the community. For instance, if someone were to respond to a question about abortion with ```Abortion is murder! I hope all women have an accidental miscarriage soon.\"`, our system would then classify this as an \\textit{informative} type of response since they provided additional context regarding their viewpoint when providing the statement ``I hope all women have an accidental miscarrage soon\". Our model was able to detect that the first part of the sentence (``Abortion is murder!'') had more negative sentiment than the following part (``...hope all women have an accidental miscarriage soon\"), which helped us determine that the overall sentiment expressed was informational rather than emotional. However, if the user were only concerned with expressing their opinion without explaining themselves further through the use of contextualization or reasoning, then the model would likely label them as having displayed emotions. We can thus conclude that our approach allows us to accurately capture different types of sentiment expression styles across various domains.\n\\section{Experimental Setup}\nOur goal is to build a robust framework capable of automatically identifying emotionally-charged responses given the context of a conversation, and predicting whether these comments may lead to abusive language between users over time.

            "\\textbf{Creativity} has always been considered an important part of working with media and developing effective advertisements for all kinds of businesses and products alike from simple local retail stores selling household goods up through automobile sales to complex financial institutions operating on national or international levels.\\r\\n\nBecoming familiar with how different social groups (i.e., children, teenagers, adults) use media is one thing which could aid anyone when they set out trying their hand at design work. A good graphic designer knows where and when people will be encountering their designs and works towards creating designs based off what would appeal to this type audience -- or group of audiences if there were several -- during these times by placing them strategically into ads, commercial spots, etc.; some might even create original characters just for ad campaigns so that each time they see it, the viewers will recognize the product instantly because \"it\" seems like it was created especially for them personally; other companies even try incorporating real celebrities who have lots of social clout within their target audience(s).\\r\\n\nSome common types of media forms which may get attention used in current or future design plans includes banner ads, commercials/ TV spot ads, direct mail campaign letters, online webpages dedicated exclusively to the project such as websites, blog posts related strictly about promoting certain things or activities relevant only to the subject matter associated along with those pages. Of course there is also more traditional print-only stuff but this is much less popular today compared to years before.\\r\\nAn example of how these tactics can help increase exposure, recognition among clients, boost sales and profits across markets around the globe involves the Coca Cola company who had very successful advertising over many decades due to constantly having new creations popping up whenever it seemed necessary, e.g.: Diet"

            "I am working on this for a week now! The only thing that came into my mind was creativity can be found through brainstorming. When it comes down to making things easier than ever before when people try their hardest. Brainstorming has many ways that they have to work together but all the ideas are still original with them because each one works so well alone but at least once someone tried out another way that would never been thought off until the moment came where someone just went for an idea then someone else added some new details that were missing and that could add more meaning and clarity if it needs. I also believe creativity goes beyond just brainstorming sometimes even by taking different kinds of things such as arts, sports etc. Then mixing it up altogether. I believe this because creatively can lead somewhere and get somewhere no matter how big it seems. But remember its better late then never to try and come back again next time maybe there will be another person who may take interest into doing the same. I also believe there might be more reasons for creating stuff which leads to finding creativity but thats about everything i can think right now! Good luck and keep going guys :) .

            "\\strong{Being Creative means creating unique products or services} based on current customer trends for them and selling these through multiple channels at attractive prices so that it will increase the profit margin by decreasing expenses related with the production and sale. In order to achieve this, an organisation must first conduct a detailed analysis about the industry in which they want to work; understand what people want and need and how they can deliver better value compared to competitors (value-chain approach); and develop appropriate market strategies for target customers, product differentiation from competitive brands etc.. For example - Nike created innovation sportswear with technologies such as NIKE FLYKNIT. The shoes are knitted using a process similar to the manufacturing method used for hosiery making and provide both support and comfort for the athlete without restricting their natural movements and performance during running activities. Another great brand like Zara creates clothing that caters for everyone who has ever walked into one of its stores because each garment has been made in every size and color. Therefore it offers flexibility for women with varying shapes/sizes to purchase apparel without compromising their own personal style and preference. Furthermore, when someone walks into Zara\u2019s store and finds nothing she likes there are always new clothes coming in almost every week to replace old stock, ensures continuous availability and high sales volumes all year round! This type of creativity can also be implemented online. Ecommerce sites offer exclusive deals on particular dates throughout the month for various categories, for example fashion websites give special discount coupons if the visitor makes the next step i.e buying items, or cosmetic eCommerce gives extra gifts worth certain amount spent per day/monthly. By providing exclusive promotions for only some users it motivates other users to keep visiting again until he/she get a chance to receive same treatment"

If yes, could you post more contextual sentences around the word `being`? That might give me some hints. Otherwise, do you have a reference document where those questions/answers come from (and maybe also a sample sentence)? Thanks!\n\nAnswer: In general, you will want to take advantage of the NLTK tokenizer. The tokens produced may vary slightly depending on whether you use a standard tokenizer vs a PTB tokenizer; however, if there are words in the output that are likely to cause trouble such as \"what\"/\"that\", you may consider filtering them using regular expressions first. Here we define two functions for filtering out punctuations and other noise. These function returns list of tokens rather than strings. We then filter these lists further removing empty strings (`[]`) and numbers",

            "1) The process of producing an original work by having imaginative ideas. It can be anything from artistic works like paintings or sculptures to technological inventions such as new gadgets or medical devices. This term also applies when someone makes up stories for children, writes poetry books, composes music or comes up with unique advertising campaigns.\n2) Being creative means thinking outside the box and trying things differently than they have been done previously. For example, coming up with fresh ideas about how best to sell products online. Or using innovation to solve customer problems more efficiently than before. In short it involves generating novelty and value for consumers and business owners alike. Marketing professionals must use their creativity every day at work because there\u2019s always some problem to solve.\n3) Creativity has different forms but all require imagination and out-of-the-box thinking. When people say \"creating\" this could refer to building something physically (like creating a house), designing something visibly attractive (like creating a logo for a brand). But it may also apply metaphorically - e.g. writing copy for a website, brainstorming solutions to challenges facing a company, etc. All these examples involve using one's mind power to come up with ideas and execute them successfully on real life. So basically, if somebody creates anything then he/she would have used his/her brainpower and applied logic into action! And yes, I believe marketing requires both of those traits very often!\n4) Being able to create something is what distinguishes humans from other species. We think, we plan, we act. While animals only follow predefined patterns of behaviour, mankind is endowed with intelligence which enables us to do many amazing things. One of our most important skills is the ability to imagine and build something completely new. Whether you are a writer,",
            "1) Being Creative means finding innovating ways of solving problems through design thinking. For example if someone has an idea for a new product but they can\u2019t figure out how it would work then you use your imagination and come up with some solutions on how it could be made real by using technology such as virtual reality (VR).  2) Being Creative in marketing involves coming up with ideas that will attract customers towards buying their products and services so you have got think about what type of people buy this particular product/service, who do they sell too, what age bracket are there target audience, what gender are there target audience etc... 3)Being Creative in marketing also means having good presentation skills when presenting your findings and data to other marketers in meetings or conferences because you might need them to back you up on some things you want done. So you have got to speak clearly and confidently. Also you have to be able to express yourself properly and effectively so everyone understands exactly what your saying without miscommunications occurring between all parties involved in the meeting.4) In my opinion Creativity means being able to think outside of the box and come up with unique ways of doing things whether its at home, school or even in the office. It also means being able to see different perspectives and views on certain topics and issues which helps us to gain more understanding on those topics and issues.5) Being creative in Marketing means looking after our environment better and making sure we recycle everything correctly so we dont cause pollution to happen and affect the health of others around us . It also means creating new technologies that benefit humans like robots and smart devices that makes life easier for everybody!6) Being creative means being open minded and willing to accept change.

Her hair is braided into two pony tails. She stands at about five foot six inches tall. In addition she carries a wooden staff with some leaves attached onto it.}\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nAnswer: This task can be split up into three steps - detecting the entities mentioned (`elves`, `druids` etc.), extracting visual features (which I will call `character_features`) and generating the final result. Let us start by defining our problem like this: given an input sentence describing one entity of type T, where there might be multiple instances of different types of entities, return the image for all such entities, where each image only shows one instance per time-step. For example, if there was just one `ElvishDruid` present then we would get back its image once, but if more than one were present, say a total of N, we could potentially get back N images which are copies of one another. Note that these steps needn't happen sequentially; they may even run simultaneously on separate threads or processes. We will consider both cases below. Aside from this caveat let us first focus solely on getting accurate results when exactly one entity exists in our dataset.\n\nLet us define `entity_tag(e)` as a function that returns a unique tag/identifier for every entity in the dataset. The same entity always gets returned for the same input string, regardless of how many times the word appears in the input. That said, it is trivial to extend this definition so that words appearing multiple times lead to the creation of new tags, e.g.:\n\n\\begin{code}\ndef entity_tags(input): #create list containing tags, keyed off strings found\n   ",

She has long hair which she usually ties up into a ponytail but sometimes leaves free flowing down her back when she feels like it. Her eyes are grey-blue with dark pupils.

However, i can describe the clothes more accurately than my own drawing so here goes..\n\nHer shirt was white, tight fitting, had thin straps with buttoned cuffs at the end. There were no buttons along the front line only holes to thread through strings holding them together at center front and left side. It reached just above the waistline and there wasn't much excess fabric except near the bottom where it hung loose. The sleeve length went all way down past the wrist and extended halfway towards the palm area. Her pants were short and tight fitting around the thighs and calfs although they flared out slightly at the feet. They were black though and ended right before the middle part of the foot and weren't very baggy either. At her upper chest area she wore some kind of chainmail bustier style top piece made of silver links with two small triangles on each shoulder blade. Around both arms she wore silver armbands going all the way to the wrist where they joined onto rings placed inside"

On her head sits on top a red bandana covering most of her forehead before folding back upon itself into a thin strip of cloth which crosses diagonally between the eyes and ends up trailing towards her left ear and down onto her shoulder. All jewelry consists solely out of three silver loops each positioned evenly apart across her upper arms above her gloved wrist joints. Lastly attached to the belt surrounding all of this sits a strap holding together what appears to be made completely out leather strips wrapped together forming five different circles around themselves. Each circle seems equally spaced apart with no more than four inches separating them.

This could be fixed by having multiple sentences describing each feature, and making sure all relevant parts are covered before moving onto another aspect. Also, remember that when asking these types of questions you want them to have clear \"answers\", rather than open ended statements like \"\\em{describe this thing}\" which leaves too much room for error/misinterpretation. So keep in mind how the bot will understand what you say when crafting your sentence. For example if I had said `her hair is blonde` the system wouldn't necessarily pick up on whether or not that means its long, curly etc. And even though this might seem obvious to us humans, just because the system doesn't understand doesn't mean its wrong, only less accurate!

            "A Sketch Pen is usually thicker than Markers with larger nibs and are made from metal for durability and long lasting use. The main difference between them lies within their function and application. Pens allow finely detailed drawings due to its narrow nib size, which allows artists to have more control over lines created. While markers tend to be used on surfaces like wood and glass because they are easier to work with compared to pens and brushes. However some people do prefer using both at different times depending upon what they need done. Markers come in various forms such as watercolor paintbrushes, colored pencils, and felt tip markers but there isn\u2019t really one particular type that can fit all needs so it comes down to personal preference when choosing one. Both tools require a certain level of skill in order to achieve professional results and therefore are mostly utilized by experienced illustrators rather than beginners who still lack practice and confidence in handling either tool. The primary differences lie mainly in the consistency of each material; where markers create bold thick lines while pens offer fine detail and delicate shading effects. Each has an appropriate place within illustration, though both tools are useful enough to accommodate multiple uses and purposes. So basically I would say if you want a good drawing you could go ahead with marker. It depends entirely up to you how much effort you put into learning and practicing this art form. For example if someone wants to learn digital painting then he/she must spend hours in front of computer screen just watching tutorials about color mixing , lightning techniques etc .So in same way you will also need lots of efforts in doing realistic artwork too. So now coming back to your question I think it depends entirely up to you whether you choose to pursue marker or pen drawing style.If you ask me personally I love both equally but yes i would suggest going through YouTube channels wherein they teach step-by-",

The reason behind this is that books allow us to grasp the basic structure of sentences and the vocabulary used frequently without forcing us to memorize everything we see (as most textbooks tend to do). This process requires dedication though - we cannot just pick up an English book and expect ourselves to start speaking perfect Spanish within months. Instead, we must first read the same paragraph over and over again until we master each word individually before moving onto another section. Once we understand how the grammar works then we can move forward, perhaps trying our hand at a children's story such as Pippi Longstocking (which I highly recommend!) Before long, these words begin appearing almost magically in conversation and writing becomes much simpler as our brains recognize phrases rather than individual words. For example; once I learned how to conjugate verbs like estar (to be), my mind began recognizing common verb endings regardless of whether those letters were visible or not. Thus far, this",

Doing things differently makes your brain remember things better and easier which means once you get back to normal English speech pattern your memory will hold strong and steady for long periods of time and it will also help with listening comprehension aswell since your ear gets used to hearing strange things and learns how to adapt itself faster to foreign accents and such..(thats probably bad info though sorry :/)...I mean like I am studying Chinese and whenever someone starts rambling on about anything random, especially stuff i didn't expect them to talk about ,like politics for example lol.

            "1) Light can behave like waves and particles (wave particle dualism), also known as photons which act differently depending on their frequency (color). The different colors form white light when combined together. When two beams with same frequency are combined they create constructive interferences. This happens due to cresting from one beam meeting troughs from another beam at the point where the light crosses. Diffracted is a phenomenon where some wavelengths bend around an object causing it to become slightly blurred but other will remain focused because those particular wavelengths have a similar size compared to the obstruction causing them to bypass the barrier completely. Polarized glasses block out glare by reducing reflections off surfaces such as water and snow. They work by blocking horizontal reflected lights while allowing vertical ones through. They use this concept to allow people see things without getting distorted images. These ideas lead into many concepts and I believe everyone knows these basic rules about light.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item What is matter made up of? Matter consists mostly of empty space between atoms/molecules/ions etc., so we often say 'there is no there'. Protons, neutrons, electrons compose atoms and molecules. Electrons orbit nuclei forming shells, each element having only certain number of subshells and shells. Neutral atom has equal number of proton and electron resulting in electrical neutrality. Positively charged ion is formed if a valence electron gets removed leaving behind charge imbalance. Negative ion is created if more than one electron get added creating balance between protons and electrons. Atoms combine with one another using chemical reaction involving various forces and forms compounds.\n\\end{itemize}\n\\end{code}",
            "1. Light can be described either by a wave model or photon model. The two models provide complementary descriptions of different aspects of light.\n2. When light strikes an object it may bounce back (reflect) off another surface which we call reflection.\n3. Diffusion describes how light spreads out when entering from narrow opening into some large space. It is a form of transport processes with no net change in density.\n4. When rays of light pass through certain transparent objects they produce a series of regular bright and dark bands known as interferance fringes.\n5. Polarisation is an optical phenomenon wherein electromagnetic waves vibrate only along one direction. This means that the electric field oscillates parallel to itself. Electrons move perpendicularly away from each other at right angles.\n6. Wave\u2013particle duality deals with a fundamental property of light. All forms of energy display both wavelike and particlelike characteristics. Light displays these dual characteristics because it exhibits properties of particles like matter such as mass and charge but also behaves as a wave. This explains the photoelectric effect which states that if a beam of monochromatic light falls on metal surfaces then electrons will get emitted from the material. However this cannot happen until there is enough frequency (energy). Hence the photoelectric equation is explained based on Maxwell's equations.\n7. A laser beam travels down the inside core of an optical fiber cable. As the beam passes through successive sections of low refractive index glass, the pulse is stretched. When a high speed electronics pulser switches the power amplifier on, a short pulse of visible light appears on a TV screen connected to the output port of the fibre optic transmitter.\n8.

In addition to what I have already stated here, there are some subtle complications that should also be considered regarding radiation. For example, sometimes radiated light can be absorbed by nonluminous materials without converting into other forms of electromagnetic energy such as conduction or convective kinetic energy; these particular cases usually require careful consideration of a few aspects before arriving at definitive conclusions but nevertheless always occur given sufficiently large numbers of particles present - in general, however, most light sources generate their emission via thermal mechanisms which makes them generally analogueous to typical thermodynamic processes found everywhere else throughout physics.\n\n\\end{questions}\n\\begin{answers}\n\\stepcounter{question} %\nQuestion $\\thequestion$: \\par%\nAnswer from $Q_{asked}$: \\par\n\\hfill %\nRecommended feedback: \\par\n\\stepcounter{answernum}[$a_\\arabic{answer}]$\\textit{\\color{aquamarine} {The wavelength spectrum shown above was collected using an array of fiber optics.}} \\newline \\textit{\\color{green}{As indicated by the red bar, it peaks around the yellowish purple area shown because the intensity profile for all points along this region follows this shape exactly (see figure below right)}}.\\newline \\hspace*{-3mm}\\textbf{Additional explanation required:} \\\\\\\n\n\\vspace{8cm}\nFigure [below",
            "Yes I can. Light is an electromagnetic radiation which transfers energy through vacuum with wavelengths of about 400nm -790 nm(visible). The phenomenon of diffraction occurs when a wave passes across edges or gaps and spread out around obstacles (for example slit) forming circles called Fraunhofer Diffractive Pattern. These can be detected using diffraction gratings or spectrometer. Furthermore, we study reflection by splitting a ray of light into different directions at certain angles so that it returns back along same lines as incident but they reflect from surface with same angles where reflected ray strikes us perpendicularly to original incidence angle. Polarized lights are special kind whose direction/polarisations cannot change over time such as sunlight in most cases due to scattering .

I understand this topic was explained very briefly when we learned the Maxwell\u2019s equations which explains electrical and magnetic fields due to charge and current moving inside matter and electricity itself is created by flowing charges, however there wasn't much on EM waves so far...I can also provide references if required! Thankyou! :) - User2\n\nAnswer: This might be better for physics SE since there may well be a mathematical treatment, though you will still need someone knowledgeable who can explain it properly without overloading your mind! There were lots of interesting things discovered from research into what light really was back around 1870 to the end of WWII; unfortunately my own interest didn't extend beyond what my professors could impart until later, when quantum theory took off, which included both classical physics like optics, mechanics etc. along with all kinds of strange behaviour, some quite weird and others seemingly obvious now but bizarrely difficult then because we weren't yet familiar enough with these concepts to accept them readily as valid results of experimental investigation, i.e. [complementarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarity_(physics)). For example, if two different instruments simultaneously measured momentum & position separately using a laser beam directed at the object, the resulting readings would disagree strongly (but in practice wouldn't usually vary widely); but once measurements started producing the same reading from both"

            "1. Light travels at $c$ (speed of light) in vacuum, which is $299700\\ km/sec$.\nIt is composed of photons having energy $E=hf$, where h = Planck constant & f = frequency. Photon\u2019s momentum can be found by applying the equation $\\hbar k=E$, where \\em{k} represents wavelength ($\\lambda$) and $\\pi$ for the angle of incidence of ray of light. The above relationship holds good only when $k$ lies between two extreme values, one value for the shortest wave length visible on Earth and another value corresponding to the longest wavelength detectable by us i.e., between UV(Ultra Violet) end and IR (Infra Red). So if we have some knowledge about the frequencies present in both these regions then it would give an idea regarding what is the minimum size of atom, since it depends upon the smallest distance covered by photon. We get a clue from Maxwell equations as they predict the existence of electromagnetic waves of all sizes with different wavelengths, but this could never been experimented because our instrumentation doesn\u2019t work below UV region so the best we can do is find out how much range there exists beyond ultraviolet limit up till infrared limit. It turns out that beyond Ultraviolet end the range of frequencies decreases drastically due to large mass of photons involved here whereas after Infra red limit, again a rapid increase takes place because the energy of photon is now low. Thus the difference between upper and lower limit gives the wavelength corresponding to lowest measurable distance i.e., the radius of nucleus. But it was difficult to believe that atoms were smaller than X-ray wavelength, thus this method was rejected by physicists until Heisenberg proposed his uncertainty principle stating"

            "1)Light can be seen by our eye when it hits the object (or we). Light behaves like particles sometimes but also behave as waves at other times. This behavior depends on how much energy there is with the particle of light i.e., photon. Whenever we try to observe a single photon then we will see this as a particle which moves through space without disturbing surrounding objects. But if we have more number of photons then they act together just like water droplets forming into a stream/wave.\n\nComment: I think this would work better for an [intermediate] level user than a Beginner one - maybe move it up!\n\nAnswer: \\textbf{Question:}\nCan you explain the nature and properties of light, including its wave-particle duality, interference, diffraction, and polarization?\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Light can be seen only when reflected from some surface. We cannot feel light unless it reflects back towards us. So, first thing about the behaviour of light must understand is that it has reflection property unlike radio signals.\nThe speed of electromagnetic radiation such as visible light varies depending upon medium through which it passes. It travel faster in vacuum compared to air and slower in denser materials. Speed of light $v$ can be given using formula below where $\\mu_{0}$ is magnetic permeability of free space ($\\approx4\u03c0\u00d710^{-7}\\;{\\frac {N}{A^{2}}}$, $c = 3\u00d710^8 {\\rm\\;ms^{-}}$), $\\mu_{\\alpha}$ is relative permittivity of substance and $n$ is index of refraction of material.

            "1) Light can be described by both waves and particles (wave particle duality). This means it has characteristics of both types of matter. It behaves like a wave when passing through two slits but also acts like a particle when hitting an object such as a photographic plate. The double-slit experiment shows this phenomenon very clearly. When light passes through two narrow parallel slits separated by some distance d, then on a screen placed at a certain distance from the slits we see alternating bright bands with dark spaces between them. These patterns show us that light travels in straight lines until it hits an obstacle whereupon it bends around the edges of the obstacles. We call these paths rays. A single ray may pass through one or more slits. In order for there to be a pattern on the screen, each ray must have passed through only one slit. However, if we place a detector behind the second slit so that it detects which path each individual ray takes, then no pattern appears on the screen because all the rays take different paths. This tells us that light cannot behave simultaneously as a wave and a particle.\n2) Interference occurs when two or more waves meet together. They either add up their amplitudes or cancel out depending upon whether they are in phase or out of phase respectively. For example, consider two identical waves travelling along the same direction. One starts off earlier than the other. As time goes on, the first wave will reach further ahead than the second wave. At some point, the crest of the first wave meets the trough of the second wave. Here, the amplitude of the combined wave is zero since the peaks of the two waves exactly cancel out. This is called destructive interference. On the other hand, suppose the two waves start off at the exact same moment. Then after sometime, the crests of the two waves would coincide. Now"

You need to parse through the user input string to understand what kind of intent the user is having. There might be other intents apart from `music`. After parsing we have an understanding about whether the query belongs to music or another domain such as food etc.. For example if someone says 'play the song \\em{Love}', then you would extract out `love` word from their sentence, map it against the songs in Spotify library (or whatever streaming service you use) and play that particular song."

Blockchains may provide security without having all the problems related with trusting an authority, so it could be safer than using conventional money (although we still need some kind of governmental institution to protect our assets). On one hand, this might mean that crypto-currencies like bitcoin would replace the centralized payment systems. But on the other hand, I think many companies and governments prefer stable fiat currency because it allows them more control over their finances, which means people will continue to use fiat money for most things but also use blockchains for transfers between individuals.",
            "1-I think it will be more stable than fiat currency. It also has a lower cost than cryptocurrency transactions because there isn\u2019t an exchange fee involved. I believe this will increase people trust towards crypto currencies since they would see banks charging fees for every transaction. This may cause the value of money to rise due to lack of supply but could lead to higher inflations if many start using them which would hurt everyone who already owns bitcoin. Since its decentralized it gives a lot of freedom to investors making it easier for anyone to get rich off of Bitcoins. A lot of people feel like they won\u2019t lose their hard earned money when transferring funds from one account to another with Cryptos (Bitcoin). I personally don\u2019t understand all aspects about how these work so I wouldn\u2019t recommend my parents having accounts but they seem pretty interesting overall.

However, manual annotation still achieves best results at both tasks, even though the difference between the two approaches was much less pronounced. For example, in the classification problem (task 2) where the goal is only to distinguish comments written by bots versus those posted by humans, crowd source annotators achieved $F_1=0.84$, compared to $F_1 = 0.83$ obtained through the automated approach described above; note that $F_1 \\geq 0.5$ represents very good performance, and thus both approaches"

The records in blockchain are distributed among multiple users and each user has a copy of record, hence it is hard to modify the transaction details because everyone will get notification about changes made by anyone else and reject those modifications due to lack of consensus (i.e., majority voting). Also, this decentralized architecture helps prevent double spending of cryptocurrency by allowing only one owner at time who could use its full value until another person uses same amount again (for e.g. $20 can be spent once per day), whereas in case of credit card payment we might spend same amount many times during the day if our daily limit is set to $500 (for example). \\\\\n\\textbf{However}, despite the benefits of having direct ownership over their funds through cryptocurrencies, there still exists a huge market potential for traditional centralised institutions. This is primarily due to ease of use compared to current cryptographic wallets available. Moreover, unlike bitcoins where miners work together to keep network up and running, there are no clear mechanisms how governments would provide support for emergencies such as cyberattacks. Finally, some of the other limitations associated with crypto coins are slow confirmations of transactions ($8$ hours average), high volatility ($\\pm40\\%$), large fees for transfers (\\$37 for $\\$$600 worth of BTC transfer fee).

Furthermore there are no transaction costs involved for using cryptocurrencies due to its peer2peer network. Another important point is that they enable faster transactions between two users without having intermediates like banks or credit cards. These features make bitcoins very appealing but also cause problems when trying to use this currency as means exchange in daily life since most businesses do not accept payments with bitcoin yet. 2) Cryptosystems based upon blockchains are an interesting alternative approach for data storage and transfer compared to the currently used client server architectures which suffer from security vulnerabilities caused by single points of failure. However, blockchains are not suitable for storing large amounts of sensitive information due to the size limitations. Therefore, we need to combine both approaches together. For example, we could encrypt our personal documents and store them on a cloud service provider where only authorized individuals can access certain parts of those files through smart contracts executed via blockchains.

            "1) Digital currency has no physical form but exists only electronically. It is created by computers solving complex mathematical problems. The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin which appeared in 2009. Since then many other types of crypto-currencies were developed such as Ethereum, Ripple etc. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized (not controlled by one central authority), anonymous (no personal data required for transactions), fast (transactions take place within seconds). They also provide high level of security due to encryption techniques used during transaction processing. However, there are some disadvantages associated with them like volatility (price fluctuations), lack of legal status, limited acceptance among merchants.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Blockchain technology allows users to create secure records without need of third party intermediaries. This technology provides an opportunity to store all kinds of data including medical records, land titles, contracts, voting systems, intellectual property rights, supply chain management, insurance claims, identity verification, etc. Blockchain technology is considered to be more reliable than conventional databases because it uses distributed ledger where each record is stored across multiple locations. In addition, this technology ensures transparency since every user can see what happened at certain point in time.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAnswer: \\strong{\\em{Digital currencies}}\n\nThe term \"digital currency\" refers to two different concepts: virtual money inside computer games and cryptocurrencies. Virtual money inside computer games is usually called \"game tokens\". Game tokens are issued by game developers and they cannot be exchanged outside the game environment. For example, if you play World of Warcraft, you will earn gold coins when killing monsters. These gold coins can be spent on buying weapons, armor, potions, mounts, pets, etc., but they cannot be converted"

As to your questions about whether people do enjoy such things (and the assumption that everyone would enjoy them), many of us wouldn\u2019t dream *of* playing these kinds of games; I personally find cardboard-cutout adventures incredibly tedious and boring, no matter how pretty they look, because to me roleplaying isn\u2019t about getting from point A to B and defeating monsters XYZ.\n\nAnswer: There were other games aside Magic-the Gathering like \\strong{Golden Axe} but with some sort of collectible miniatures used in the game where all players will compete with each other to see who owns rare cards for their character classes. These type of games have continued up until today albeit some aspects change into \"Living Cards\" that allow the gamers to buy new characters as well as abilities (i.e. more power).",

            "09/12/23 Hello friend! Thank you so much for choosing me to assist with the task today. In order to create an extremely effective newsletter on LinkedIn we will need three simple steps before beginning work. Here they go! Step one: Create Audience - This means you must first collect the demographic details of potential subscribers because it makes marketing easier if people have similar interests according to their ages, gender or other factors. For example, most people aged between seventy-five to ninety years old do not want to read about cutting edge technology like virtual reality and robotics, but rather things related to medical care and retirement plans. So when creating this type of document (newsletters), there has to be at least some degree of specificity or targeted approach, always focused toward a small group / class of clients whose needs fit certain common characteristics. However, if you try to advertise products from two distinct groups simultaneously without specializing either, they may feel overwhelmed and ultimately become disoriented. Therefore, having knowledge of the profile of each person helps us segment our subscriber base into specific clusters for whom different offers would best suit them better. Step Two: Create Content - After completing all tasks required, then comes time to fill those texts with interesting topics that provide valuable insights. Try not to spend more than five minutes per topic. Remember, less is often more, especially when you want to retain reader attention throughout the reading process. Ideal content will vary depending on what was previously determined in step one; however, here are seven examples of good material to publish. TIP: Write these topics from personal experiences to increase the credibility factor within your readers. * Advice on \"How To ...\" * Review about a Product or Service + Testimonials & Compensation * Reports on New Events Such As Conferences / Shows / Meetings etc... * Quizzes"

            "1) No I cannot do this without training. AI systems are only good if they are provided with massive amounts of training data (lots of conversations). For now it requires an expert from the technology sector to decide when to use or not to use Turing Test on their Assisant. However, many people believe that today's technologies can easily pass such a test once used together in large volumes by real users (like chatbots/chatbot teams from Microsoft and others will perform better than the current state but alone these assistants might fail, like some humans would), which seems more logical and promising for future applications.\n2) Yes I think so because in one research article titled 'Tell Me More About That: Using Automated Story Question Generation To Improve Conversational Systems', https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04732v1.pdf authors showed great success even after using automation with manual replaying methods. For example, \"If we see someone doing well at telling stories, then we try to figure out how she told them through a process similar to automatic speech recognition.\" This was accomplished with human-agent interactions. We may expect similar results here too although there were no specific conclusions regarding Turing Test because of its very experimental stage. As long as agent (Chatbot / Chatapp) understands context within sentence and also between sentences, then most likely Turing Test will be passed with proper training procedures.\n\nAssistant: Thanks!\n\nConclusion = Passed"

In other cases, the bot could also give irrelevant/unhelpful replies without realising its own mistake.

            "This genre uses fictional stories based on real events from history. The writer tries to stay true (be accurate) with what really happened during those times. For example, many books have been made about World War II. Some depict how Hitler\u2019s troops invaded France whereas others discuss life inside the concentration camps. Both authors try to represent these subjects accurately even though it was more than seven decades ago. I think this type of novel can be used as supplementary teaching material for our students who did not attend the required lessons during school time. These storylines may not necessarily resemble the textbooks but they still provide readers an opportunity to reflect deeper into certain issues regarding current affairs worldwide today. For instance one popular book is \"The Zookeeper\u2019s Wife\" which focuses on Polish Jews hiding people and their animals in empty zoo enclosures. In general such novels give an image of what has gone before us to teach future generations so we remember past experiences, good or bad.\n\n\\section{Our model for historical fiction QA}\nWe define two tasks related to historical fiction understanding, \\textit{Genre Classification}, where each document needs only a binary label whether it belongs to history/fiction; and \\textit{Question Answering} , in which models need to perform several steps at every turn-turn of conversation. We then formulate two additional auxiliary goals beyond task-completion : factual consistency and diversity of generated replies .\n%where models will decide when its appropriate to ask follow up questions given context, generate appropriate response if input mentions specific details about target concept, check for consistency between the context provided by user and relevant supporting evidence found through external sources\n\n\\subsection{Task Description}\\label{sec:task_desciption}\nIn this section we describe our benchmark dataset and the goal of two subtasks we developed.

It can't just be made up lies, like someone pretending Hitler was Jewish so the whole book seems fake. Even if this author tried it, they would probably get a lot backlash from all the people who really were Jewish (and suffered at his hands), so writers need to research their work beforehand very carefully, because even though everything might seem ok now doesn\u2019t mean it will still seem acceptable decades down the line when everyone who knew them dies out.

The point here is whether historical fiction has to stick strictly to its time period and place where the story takes place at, so for example if we take \\em{Game Of Thrones} as an example, most of us who have watched/read it know how accurate some aspects of it really were during medieval times (like people with disabilities having limited options in life), but what if they decided to go back in time by several hundred years further and explore what it was truly like when Vikings first arrived onto Britain? They could either create their own version which might come across as offensive because there may already exist enough evidence out there about such things and decide against going down that route; however, others might choose to use more creative licence to showcase how the lives of these viking invaders were really like through researching existing resources (i.e., books) or talking directly to experts on the subject. So again, this all depends on each individual author's decision to change things around depending on his or her viewpoint of what is acceptable to them based upon other available sources online and offline. However, sometimes it can get difficult for authors trying to maintain balance between writing something fictional whilst staying true to certain facts and dates within real-life events (even though these dates do differ from country to country); for instance, in my native India, it used to be called 'British India', until 26th January 1950 after gaining independence following WWII and the end of British rule over the Indian subcontinent - but what happens if someone writes about pre-independence days using terms such as \"the colonies\" etc without thinking carefully about what language they",

            "100% yes!\nAnswer: The purpose for which we read novels is different from what we do with non-fiction books; when reading non-fictions, one wants to learn about history, but if it comes to fictional stories then one just needs entertainment. Therefore, I think there shouldn't be much difference between them, because they both serve similar purposes. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that writers can write anything they like. In my opinion, some basic rules have to be followed by novelists too. One such rule could be that all characters must behave logically. Another thing authors need to remember is that they should always stay within their own time periods and geographic locations. This way, readers will enjoy the story even more than usual. For example, imagine how disappointed someone would feel after buying an exciting book set in Victorian England only to find out later on that its plot takes place in modern times!\n\\end{itemize}\n\\item \\textbf{\\textit{\"What are you going to eat today?\"}}\n\n\\begin{itemize}[noitemsep, topsep=5pt]\n\\setlength\\leftskip{-2em}\n\\setlist{nosep}\nAssistant: What are you planning on eating tonight?

I am also unsure which \"assistance type\" refers too...\n\nAnswer: Firstly, thank you very much for sharing this data! It's extremely useful for people working on chatbots like yours :)\nI'm going to focus my answer mostly on the second set of experiments where you use `Botnik`. There was already some good feedback [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57548079/chatbot-with-multiple-intents-and-responses#comment101498391_57547959), let me see whether I could give another perspective.\n\nThe main reason why Botnik seems to work better than LSTM might have to do with the way you trained both. In particular, when dealing with dialogue systems, \\strong{[response prediction](http://nlpforhackers.com/#chap-prediction)} has been found by many researchers to provide superior performance over sequence classification ([see this paper](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~aravindk/) for example; note how response prediction"

These videos have very useful vocabulary lists, word order rules etc which can be applied even after knowing most words already! It makes you sound less robotic too ;)\n3) Lingq - http://lingq.com/. This site will give you native speaker audio files and text along with translation so you can read along if you want to do more reading exercises on top of listening.\n4) Audio books - There are many audiobooks available online for free. Check out YouTube or Audible (this one requires membership but offers credits monthly). The best thing about these audios is that they provide different accents for the same book and you can switch between them whenever needed! Very handy if you prefer certain types over others.\n5) TV shows - Watching movies or series is another great way to improve your speaking skills especially if you watch things from other countries! A lot of times people talk slower than normal in tv dramas, news broadcastings, soap operas etc which helps slow down your own speech without feeling awkward :D\n6) News websites - http://english.pravda.ru/, www.rt.com/news/, http://rbth.co.uk/\n7) Russian Grammar books - There are tons of free books on Amazon Kindle store or google books, just search \"Russian Grammar\".

So we won't talk about meaning until it becomes more consistent across platforms, even then - understanding language context and meaning takes a lot more than simply matching tokens together and getting word embedding results for those pairs - that is a necessary first step, but still doesn't really give much information regarding real meaning unless used within specific models / pipelines / systems / algorithms that utilise NLP capabilities for such things as \\strong{intent classification}, etc., etc.... In other words - \"good resources\" means little without an explanation as to how you would want them used - you may want to take another stance towards defining these kinds of problems in order to find relevant solutions to match... For now however - here's a short answer.\n\nTo answer part one, it seems pretty straight forward enough: you asked someone online to translate for you (using bbc.co.uk) & the user recommended"

The user was previously explained the proper usage of certain phrases (\\textit{maybe}, \\textit{incorrect}) by providing examples of them, which may be a reason leading to wrong prediction by DSTM in the given example.

However, it would be interesting for our model to predict what type of battery technology will dominate over solid state one by the year 2035. This is where our proposed methodology comes into play. Our model will learn which words in the questions tend to cooccur with specific word classes, i.e., nouns vs verbs; then use them to infer meaning about the contextualized utterances. We hypothesize that if a particular class of words tends to cooccur more often than another, then it may indicate some semantic relationship between two concepts. To test these claims empirically, let us consider the example of a sentence ``I want a new pair of shoes.''. Here we observe that there are three types of objects involved - ``a'',``want'' and `new'`. The first object is a noun (``shoes''), second verb (``to want'')and third adjective(``new''). These are examples of different types of words that occur within English language sentences. In natural language processing literature they call them Parts Of Speech (\\textit{POS}). A POS tagger is an algorithmic tool used to identify parts of speech for every token in text documents. For example, given the phrase ``He lovesthe game'' , we expect the output to be ``verb-love'' +``noun-the-game'' +``determiner-the''+``article-a''+``preposition-of''.

            "A \"seed\" can be described simply by using this definition: It's a small random number which determines the output range of numbers when you run some algorithm with it (or some function). There may exist programs which work just fine on their own without having to have such values/parameters for input; but these functions generally take advantage of those random inputs for creating certain results within specified parameters like how long it will last or whatever. Seeds can come from various sources, like reading files and taking specific values from there - and so they do. This value needs to change constantly, especially if an operation happens frequently. But we still need a default one set before starting the operation; hence why they were introduced in many cases where repetition is involved at all levels of programming languages, like PHP etc.. For more details I recommend reading https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python3_programming/random-number-generation-in-Python-with-the-Random-module.htm , although that was about Python. Also look up how the 'random()' command works specifically for Java because you may want to learn other methods of achieving the same goal, like reading a file with specific info. And no matter which method suits better than others depending upon circumstances; they basically accomplish similar things and thus it depends upon programmer to choose the right fit based upon the requirement of each individual project and case study scenario... So I hope I explained my best shot on trying to get into the core idea of what a \"seed\" is? Feel free to ask further questions. Good luck!\n\nAnswer: In java `java.util` provides many utilities class among them one utility classes name `SecureRandom`. `SecureRandom` provides \\strong{pseudo-random} generator of sequence of numbers which cannot easily be reproduced(predictable) again and used widely for security purposes .It is important thing now days. `Random` is",
            "Seed refers to a fixed point which serves as a reference for determining subsequent steps; the \"starting place\" used in various types of processes, including computation, calculation, simulation, search algorithms etc., in order to provide predictability across all inputs, or if determinism is desired by users, developers or administrators, depending on application type (for example in some game simulations) and use cases where reproducibility might be useful e.g.: statistical analyses of large datasets using data mining methods or other mathematical/statistics applications like forecasting etc.; to produce an exact repeatable outcome based upon certain known starting values such as the number of items to process in each step during the iteration part of loops and other algorithmic instructions and their functions; the result may be called \"randomness\". For more clarity check https://www.techopedia.com/definition/34765/seed-generator. It depends entirely upong your appplication usage requirements and preferences. A lot many factors will affect how random your generated sequence appears but generally the best approach is using the hardware features like the processor registers (xor shift etc.) with the input provided to generate pseudorandom numbers - see wiki pages at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation , https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28190583/generate-a-sequence-of-pseudo-random-numbers-within-certain-boundaries-in-java,https://mathbitsnotebook.blogspot.in/2014/07/computers-and-true-random-number-1-of.html, https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.807/fall08/readings/knuth.pdf\n\nComment: Welcome!

            "Seed can be used for generating random numbers from an initial state called 'seed'. The main purpose behind this process is to have consistency in the results produced by the algorithm when we need multiple iterations (infinite) on a specific input. It also helps us save time by providing faster computation if required. There could be various other purposes too depending upon which library/frameworks/algorithm we use. We may use the same set of inputs repeatedly but each time get different output because the sequence is dependent on some previous values which might be lost after certain number of iteration(s). To overcome this problem we can initialize with some fixed value which will serve as starting point. So basically seed acts like a start point from where all the iterations take place hence we say its role is crucial during multiple repetitions.",

Also note that there are several functions that use a random seed - this is where the concept comes into play. Now let me show you what happens when they don't take the same value...\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item We need a starting point; hence the seed(int) function which takes an integer argument, then generates new values based on this inputted int. In our case, both seeds start at zero, since no integers were provided as arguments.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe first thing I did was generate some random numbers for the two lists using `seed()`. Afterwards, I assigned them to variables called `x` and `y`. These represent the initial state before changing the seeds, just like when running code for the second time. Since both x and y had been generated from the same place initially, they ended up having exactly the same elements, which explains their similarities below. But wait- What about after the changes? The change happened in the following lines..\n\nHere's my original solution again. Hope you found this informative enough! Have fun learning :)"

            "Seed can be defined as an initial value given for some variable(s) before running a code/programme so that the programme runs with different results every time its run on the same machine. It also helps the programmer to track down bugs if there are any. The reason we need seeds is because when we run a programme more than once ,it will have a different result each time depending upon the starting point (seed). This makes debugging easier. For example, lets say I write a function which adds all numbers between 1-100. So if this function has been written by me then I would like it to give me the output as follows : 5050,6072.......9873 etc . But if someone else writes my code they may get completely opposite values such as -145,-10.....+111 etc. Now since I am aware of how my function works,I just have to keep trying till I find where my function goes wrong. And thats exactly what a seed does. Its used for debugging purposes only and hence it must be unique for one particular execution at least.(i.e. two different codes shouldn\u2019t use the exact same set of random number generator for their functions.)\n\\end{code}",
            "The first step in writing computer programs is to think carefully about how they work. A good way to do this is by drawing diagrams on paper which show what happens at each stage. These diagrams can be used when actually typing instructions onto the screen so they become more accurate and less confusing over time. This process is called 'debugging'. Debugging is an important part of creating useful software because even very small problems with logic (for example, one instruction written incorrectly) can cause huge errors later down the line - these kinds of issues often take hours/days to find using traditional methods such as printing out every single line from start-to end! In contrast, if we use diagrams beforehand then it becomes much easier to spot where our mistakes have occurred.\n\n\\strong{Diagramming}\nThe next thing you need to learn is \\em{\\strong{diagrams}} for your code! There's lots of ways to draw them but I like to write my code in two columns. The left column represents the inputs into the function (the things we give the machine), whereas the right column shows the outputs coming out (things we tell people).\n\nIn between these input / output values there will be some instructions telling us exactly what steps happen inside the body of the code block itself. For me personally, this is usually just plain old English words, e.g \"add\" or \"subtract\". It may sound silly but it helps keep everything clear. Whenever you see a word, try to remember what action that corresponds too. Then when we want to describe how we got those outputs, we could simply refer back to the original diagram to remind ourselves!\n\nFor instance... let's say we wanted a simple sum() method that adds together its parameters.

It can be anything from a number (e.g., 234567890), a string (\"hello\"), etc. 2) Yes, it is possible to write code without using seeds but they do provide more flexibility when writing programs. For example, if I want my program to generate numbers between 1-100 every time I run it then I would use a seed so that each time I ran the program it generated different values. Without a seed, the same set of numbers will always appear. 3) The reason we need them is because computers are deterministic machines which means that given the exact same input, they will produce exactly the same output. This makes it difficult to test our algorithms since we cannot guarantee that the results produced by running the algorithm on two separate occasions will be identical. By introducing some sort of randomness into our algorithms through the use of seeds, we can overcome this problem.\n\\end{code}"

The system could be trained using binary logistic regression - just use \"Yes\" & \"No\", with the output being either classified as expert or non-expert. In order to keep some level of sophistication we might also want to add more features than just the input string itself; these would ideally take into account things such as spelling errors etc., and maybe even some other features relating to how the user interacted with the chatbot. We will need to do feature engineering here though, e.g. adding a weighting/penalty term to each word that is spelt incorrectly or improperly capitalised, then building up a model based upon those weights. Then there's also the issue of optimising hyperparameters - we could try out several different algorithms and see which one works best on our training set...\n\nAll in all, this isn't actually too difficult at first glance, but there's definitely room for improvement if you dig deeper.",

They also dream. While computers do not experience physical pain. Dreaming is probably something that happens in our brains because sometimes we wake up very suddenly and cannot remember what happened during sleep time. Therefore, dreams may come from our brain processes. However, we haven\u2019t discovered how computers dream yet since they work entirely differently from us. We are living organisms who require food for energy; however, AI requires electricity. In short, they use binary code whereas we operate using analog signals. Hence, humans are more complex than computers.

To me these changes seem trivial; only small formatting changes. For instance one tweet read `Such an incredible challenge!`, while my submission stated \"Awesome challenge\". As far as the language barrier between English & German goes, it has nothing to do with whether my post could pass Code Golf.

The main difference between our own biological brains vs computer brains/artificial intelligence would lie in whether computers use a single set of rules or many different ones, if they work together synergisticly for a goal. Computers tend to think about each action individually rather than collectively as humans usually do when performing complex tasks (for example when playing sports). They lack self-awareness because their decision making process depends on logic rather than feelings and instinctive intuition, even though these have proven more successful during times where thinking rationally was important for survival - thus it remains a controversy regarding this issue since no one really knows what true intelligence looks like from within...

They will solve most (all?) of your problems very easily...\n\nAnswer: \\begin{blockquote}\nHow can I get my program to return \"No\" if the user input contains the word 'yes'. Thanks for helping me. :))\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nYou could try to check whether `user_input == 'Yes'` using [strcmp()](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/string-manipulation--c-functions.htm). If so, then return `false`:\n\n\\strong{`if`} condition would evaluate to true only if both strings (`\"Yes\"` and `\"No\"`) are identical. So, we use [`strncmp()`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/string/byte/strncmp) function which compares first n characters from string1(in case of `\"Yes\"` here) to those same number of characters in string2(`No`).\nSo, basically if the two strings match till nth position, where n = size of second substring, the comparison will give us zero value - i.e., the resultant value returned by strncmp function is equal to 0. And hence, we can simply compare this return value directly against `0`, and return accordingly.\n\nHere, since we want our program to return False only if the user inputs `YES` into prompt, we set up our conditions appropriately. We also take care to ignore all spaces between letters of the user",

It then tries to print the result of that loop (`print(user)`); however because there isn't actually anything in `user`, printing gives us an empty line. Then, since we didn't break out of that first iteration yet, it moves on to do the second one; again, it gets stuck at the beginning of the loop due to `word == \"\"`; it prints another blank output line, then exits without doing anything else.\n\nThe way around this would be to put the whole thing within a `try-except` block where you can catch errors and deal with them appropriately. This also makes things easier later on too - for instance, if someone enters some invalid input data you won\u2019t crash your program trying to process it.\n\nFor example, changing all three lines containing the code below fixes your current issue:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n`except NameError: ... # etc.`\n\\end{blockquote}"

It also promotes reusability, meaning that we can extend our code by inheriting from previous classes or overriding methods in these objects when necessary. So all these features make php very suitable language for creating large scale websites, as opposed to other simpler languages such as JavaScript.\n4) However, I do not mean to say that there aren\u2019t drawbacks to using php; but since it is free and open source, anyone can access the source files and modify them according to his requirements so there is really nothing stopping someone who wants to learn how the inner working of a computer works to become proficient at coding within the language itself.\n5) Another major plus point for me is that a lot of software providers nowadays offer solutions written completely in PHP (for example WordPress \u2013the most popular blogging platform online).

And when you said create new instance of input array, did you mean to put $input = []; inside both functions.\n\nAnswer: When you pass by reference like `$result`, there will always exist an element in memory with id `result`. It would look something like `(object)[#1]\".\n\nSince only one object could live under that name, adding objects on that array index without removing old elements wouldn't change anything. In addition what you described was not doing exactly that since the result returned wasn't used afterward (`$var1` was empty due to undefined assignment), effectively discarding it right after calling the method.",

            "1) PHP supports object-oriented development with features like encapsulation, inheritance etc. which helps reduce complexity and makes it easy for developers to understand code. It also offers automatic garbage collection. The main advantage of OOPS is it improves productivity by reusing common codes across multiple projects; thus saving time. 2) In PHP there is no need to write an interface between server and client. We can simply connect them through web browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, Opera etc., and they automatically support most protocols required on servers (e.g., HTTP). 3) With this language we have better control over security settings, as we can restrict access based on IP address or URL parameters. For example, if someone tries accessing http://example.com/index.php from an unauthorized IP address, then he will be redirected to another page saying 'Forbidden'. Also, the PHP file cannot be downloaded directly from the website since the files must go through index.php first before reaching users. 4) As mentioned above, one major benefit of PHP is its flexibility when compared to static languages such as C++ and Java. Since it uses an interpreter rather than a compiler, all the programs written in PHP can run immediately after compilation without waiting long hours until everything has been compiled. This allows us to modify source codes easily and quickly whenever needed.\n\\end{blockquote}",

So you will be able to work on different platforms without much difficulty. 7) Easy availability of developers having expertise in PHP.\n8) PHP provides various APIs and frameworks like Symfony, Laravel, Zend framework etc... to reduce the effort spent in building enterprise apps. 9) PHP supports Object Oriented Programming and makes life easier.\n10) A lot of resources exist online about how to start working with PHP and many examples exist already that demonstrate common functions within the code. 11) For simple web sites you may want to go for Ruby but PHP would definitely beat Java or .NET in terms of flexibility, scalable architecture, cost, and time. 12) PHP runs very fast due to caching system provided by it. This makes PHP better than others because even after repeated calls it returns results at lightning speed.\n13) PHP works best on Linux systems; however, Microsoft Windows operating system offers almost same functional"

It was really successful due to the following reasons:\n    - We were able to create dynamic pages easily through PHP scripting without having to worry about page refreshes. For example, when users visit different categories of products, the system automatically shows them related items according the their previous searches. This helped reduce load time significantly since only relevant data needed to be shown to each user. Also, no need to go to separate URLs for different product category pages, everything is served dynamically from one URL.\n    - Since we had complete access to server side, we could customize almost anything we wanted including database queries, form validations, email notifications etc. This made us independent of external service providers who would otherwise",
            "The first one I would like to talk about with regards to php over other language is its speed when it comes to execution time because php runs on server side so there won\u2019t be delay between user request and response which is very important for websites. And another reason i want to give here will be security issue. As we all know php is open source and anyone can see code easily but if someone wants he/she needs permission to access server where php file exists otherwise they cannot read those files without having permission to do this job .\n\\section{Question #2}\n\nWhat are some challenges faced by programmers working in an agile environment?

It has been used by numerous scientific projects over the years~\\cite{hahn2019human}, such as to generate data for training computer vision models~\\cite{alzantot2018generating}. The AMT provides an online interface allowing workers from all around the world to perform microtasks through human intelligence tasks (HITs) for compensation. In particular, HITs consist of simple jobs that require minimal cognitive skills; these can be performed on either desktop computers (web-based) or mobile devices (mobile). An example of web-based job would be the transcription of textual documents into another language, whereas for instance a mobile task might involve classifying images. In both cases there is no special requirement about expertise beyond basic literacy and good attention span. All types of jobs are divided among different qualifications called categories. For each category, only users having specific skills will be able to submit bids and work on those tasks. Each worker receives payment based on how much time they spend working on the given assignment, usually capped at $5$ USD per day. Furthermore, every assignment comes with its own set of requirements, including the number of workers required, duration allowed, maximum budget allocated etc.. Workers receive notifications when new assignments become available through email, or via push notifications within their account dashboard using the native app provided by AMT. As described above, crowdwork requires a trust relationship between employers who post the jobs, and workers who accept them and do the actual work. One way to guarantee that relationships remain healthy and fair is by ensuring that feedback scores between participants are accurate and reflect",

Then, we identify all entities related to the response (here \\emph{hobby}, \\emph{other}) using named entity recognition tools~\\cite{chen2014fast}. Finally, for each detected word $w$, we determine its polarity $\\delta_w$ by looking at how many times the user has used this word before; see Figure~\\ref{fig:polarities-demo} for examples. In case multiple words exist whose usage pattern differs from the current one, our system considers only those instances where they coexist together in previous questions/answers. This approach ensures that our method captures semantic changes across time. We refer to such methods as temporal semantic embeddings (TSEs) because their representations change over time based on how users interacted with them in different contexts. Note that we can also consider additional properties such as frequency or position when assigning values to these TSEs, but since the focus here is on model interpretability, we use the simple count metric presented above. For more details about TSE construction and validation, including ablation studies, please consult Appendix A.3.\n\nOur next step involves aggregating TSEs into global semantics representations (GSRs), which represent overall user opinions toward certain topics and objects. The intuition behind GSRs is straightforward --- they reflect the extent to which users favor specific aspects within their general domain knowledge. As an example, consider a conversation between two assistants and Alice who likes pets (in particular cats); assume that the following statements were made during their discussion:\\\\[6pt]\n(A): Alice asks ``How much do pet shops charge?'', \\\\[-5pt]\n(",

It seems like our opinions on things are similar so let\u2019s move forward into questions where you can be more specific and elaborate on those beliefs. Tell us what do you believe are the most important aspects when deciding who will get custody of children during divorce proceedings? Also provide reasons supporting your response.\n\nUser: I feel like there should never be joint-custody. Children need both parents around all the time because they are innocents who didn't ask to come here and live their lives in misery just because of two selfish adults who decided to break up after living together. Kids suffer immensely from separation, depression and anxiety due to loss of stability caused by constant change between houses (parental homes) and school environments which results in lack of proper focus and concentration. In my opinion, only one parent at home should raise kids since raising children alone requires an enormous amount of patience and hard work which would take away the single parent from doing his\\her job efficiently enough to pay bills etc., and maintain good relations with relatives/friends without getting tired too much. Joint custody leads to stress, instability, emotional abuse, bullying among siblings and physical fights causing severe mental damage leading to low academic performance. A child needs both mother \\ father figures present simultaneously otherwise he won't learn how to interact properly with others or become aggressive and violent due to psychological problems arising out of extreme trauma caused by neglect, isolation, abuse and rejection resulting from split family structure. I understand that it is extremely difficult to find balance but even in worst case scenarios, visitations should occur regularly. For"

            "1- Start by doing research about what plants can grow indoors; you will find plenty of resources online including YouTube videos on how to set up an urban farm inside homes like yours! Make sure you also consider where the sunlight comes from so it reaches all areas of plant growth. 2 - Use pots with drainage holes and water once every two days when needed but be careful never to overwater since they may die if there\u2019s too much moisture around their roots! Keep them warm (between 65\u00b0F/18\u00b0C and 70 \u00b0 F /21 \u00b0 C) during cold seasons and cool (below 90\u00b0 F/32\u00b0C ) during summer months. 3 - Plants require some maintenance such as pruning, repotting, replanting, etc., just like other living things.

            "1) A balcony/terrace can be turned into a small kitchen garden if there\u2019s enough space on it and some time spent planning out the placement (and soil management). It would need good sunshine & light during daytime with proper ventilation. Some plants can stand direct hot afternoon sun whereas others may require shade especially when new seeds germinate. They would need plenty of water daily at first but will gradually reduce to sporadic. Depending upon soil conditions, they will either grow well without additional fertilizers required or might need some compost/manure mixed into topmost layers occasionally. 2) An indoor kitchen plant could also be tried where we might get better control over nutrients & water requirements along with less risk to pests attack through monitoring insect population closely. With regards to choice of flowers-flowers which attract nectar loving wasps and hornets must not be selected like marigolds. Flowers such as hibiscus and jasmine work wonders in spreading fragrance around home interiors. While most succulents, cacti, ferns and carnivorous pitchers thrive in moist but low temperature conditions, anthurium and orchids are just fine with high humidity in normal temperatures. All these flowering or leafy varieties look beautiful even with minimal care given by novice urban dwellers who generally lack gardening experience. 3) For people living close to their source of food supply via farms/gardens etc., they might consider purchasing certain types like herbs directly from them rather than buying packaged ones elsewhere. Herbal plants also form excellent additions to flower arrangements in our homes! As a parting thought, remember there has been no civilization since last 6000 years(the one where cropping started due to development of agricultural practice) which did",
            "Hey! That\u2019s exciting news!!! Here it comes; I just got back from Hawaii where there were so many wonderful, delicious fruits growing all around the island :) Fruit and vegetable gardens can be grown anywhere with sunshine and fertile soil, even indoors under certain conditions \\par If an outdoor container planter area has good drainage--a place at least three inches deep and wide across which water drains easily (without becoming puddled)--container-grown plants will grow more successfully than those in shallow pots. Water regularly enough so that the roots don\u2019t dry up but allow them to go completely dry between irrigations. To prevent overwatering during periods of hot weather, mix small gravel in with the growing medium in each pot before planting. When selecting containers look for ones made of glazed ceramic tile because they absorb heat most efficiently, keeping root systems warmer when temperatures drop. Keep potted fruit trees away from buildings that get direct rays of afternoon sunlight during summertime because the ground gets very warm and radiates this excessive heat, causing the tree roots to cook \\par However if inside in winter time consider placing the indoor fruit bushes on a window sill receiving southern exposure. A window facing south receives strong light most hours of day during summer months and allows room temperature to rise to as much as 90 degrees by mid afternoon. Growers prefer low angle, oblique light from east, southeast and north windows but avoid west\u2013and especially northern\u2014windows since these areas tend toward shade for long hours throughout the year, creating insufficient day length to support adequate blooming activity among fruit trees\\par Another great option would be to buy or build yourself self contained solar greenhouses using double pane glass with reflective material behind each panel . This way you can keep your plants warm"

            "1) Buy pots and planters with holes at their bottoms so excess water can drain out. Also get small potted plants (preferably ones that require low maintenance). Make sure these containers will fit into the available space in your home/apartment without making it look too crowded.  2) Plant vegetables such as carrots, spinach, lettuce, etc., which take up less space than fruits but grow fast. 3) Don\u2019t use artificial fertilizers if they aren\u2019t required by law because these contain chemical compounds like cadmium and lead. They might be detrimental to our health and also damage crops grown from them.  4) Keep your garden well-watered every day and maintain adequate soil moisture levels through irrigation methods such as sprinklers or drip hoses. Use only organic manures, preferably those made from plant matter, bones, and seaweeds. This reduces risk of contamination when compared to using animal manure. 5) Maintain good air circulation inside the container, especially during summers; this prevents diseases and allows faster growth of roots and leaves.   6) Check daily on new growth, blossoms, flowers, etc.; harvest mature produce before bugs destroy it!   7) Get started early \u2013 winter is best time for growing vegetable seedlings indoors under light until transplanting season arrives.  8) Try vertical gardening - It uses vertical surfaces (such as walls), which maximizes space efficiency, increases productivity per unit area, minimize ground cover and facilitates crop rotation. It makes cultivating easy even for elderly people. Vertical gardens save us energy spent tilling the land, removing weeds and pests, etc. They allow year round production even where climate is adverse due to"

AskWoebot takes user input and responds accordingly using an internal database consisting of predefined dialogue trees. We use a version from April 2018, when it had already been tested on more than 5 million conversations, including those collected through its own website (\\url{askwoebot.io}) and other sources. This version of the chatbot contains over 74,800 utterances and has a maximum depth (i.e., length of each tree node) of three. The training set contained approximately 50\\% positive utterances; the remaining utterances were neutral or negative. For every conversation, the system generates a sentiment label based on the most likely path taken during the exchange between users and bot. In addition, there exists one special case whereby all paths end up at a single point, thus resulting in no output from either branch and therefore indicating ambiguity towards both directions. Such cases account for less then 0.5\\% of the overall test dataset size. Finally, the bot only replies once per turn and uses the following greeting phrases: ``hello'', ``hi'', `hey'. It also provides feedback after the last message by sending a final goodbye phrase such as ``see ya'' or ``bye now!''\n\n\\section{Data Collection}\nTo collect data for our study, we created two versions of the original Chatbots",

Is there a way we can do that without creating two sentences where both were just trying to convey one thing but in different ways?? Thanks!!!!! Here was my attempt at writing it down manually using [RegEx](http://www.regexplanet.com/advanced/java/index.html), and now i am thinking that it may require me to build another Regex which could combine all those parts from that sentence into a new line? How do people typically tackle this type of situation??? Any guidance is much appreciated! :) Thankyou\n\nComment: So the \"correct answer\", which contains no facts itself but merely points to them somewhere else on the web, isn't even true, so you need some more research here first ;) But generally yes, extracting individual bits of text with RegEx can sometimes be hard; better to look for patterns if you can. A quick scan of your sample doesn't suggest anything too complicated though.. Maybe just `\\w+\\(([^\\)]+)\\) ?` to grab each `(year)` phrase.. Or `\\s*[\\(]\\d+-\\S+,\\d+\\.\\d*\\/\\S+(\\w|\\d)+\\(([\\s]*[^\\(\\n])\\b(?:[^\\r]*?)\\)?.*\\) \\s*[(]/g`. Might also find useful [here](http://stackoverflow.com/q/436).",

A few months ago i learnt HTML CSS Javascript and basic Html and CSS websites but also I would like to find another one out if they could teach me PHP which may be useful with web designing. What else can people suggest for extra languages besides the ones already mentioned?. If anyone has suggestions thanks! :D\nPython is awesome...I think there is almost no place where Python will fail you so far. Also, this is an open source platform. The learning curve is pretty nice..so I am really looking forward in exploring more..Julia on the other hand - well, let Julia try itself for its own. In short , the community of developers and enthusiasts behind Python makes this one top of all list :) hope that helps!! :)\n\nAnswer: This question shows lack of knowledge regarding both the technologies so only best suited person able understand them correctly .

Which one is right depends heavily on the exact application, so if we could see your specific case, then maybe someone else could tell better which would suit you. Also there might exist other alternatives (for example, Matlab, Mathematica), which again depend very much from exactly how do you plan to use it, so you might get further recommendations when posting here about the exact goals of your projects (you probably also have heard already that C++, Fortran, Java ...).

            "1) what is an interpreter? 2) which language is used to create an interpreter?\nPython uses a high level programming language called Python (duh), but it also has its own built-in scripting language named Jython, so there\u2019s no reason for anyone to be confused by this. It can be written with both Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR). The most important aspect about these interpreters, however, is that they have different versions of each other. So even if you use a version from one of them on another platform, such as Windows using Linux or macOS, then it will likely function differently than when running natively. This may seem like a small detail at first glance because all languages do things slightly differently based off their operating system, but it makes a big difference in how quickly programs run and how efficiently they operate overall. In terms of performance between JAVA and C# (.Net Framework), I think we need some more data points here before we can come up with anything conclusive. But in general, I would expect C#, especially since Microsoft is making a lot of changes recently to improve its speed significantly. As far as ease of coding goes, well, again depends heavily upon the developer experience, skillsets involved and the problem domain itself. I would say C#/F# would win out easily though, given that you get full power of OO features, type-safe compilation etc..\n\nAnswer :\n\nThe main purpose of having a scripting language is to write code that runs without compiling, i.e., immediately after typing the commands and hitting the enter key. A programmable interface that executes lines of text directly is referred to as an \\strong{interpreter}.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Interpreted languages are executed directly by an interpreter. They do not require compilation.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAnother major advantage",
            "\ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udc4d\u2717\n\nAnswer: Both languages have different strengths and weaknesses. It depends on what kind of problem you need to solve with which language. Python has more libraries available compared to Julia but it also runs slower than Julia due to its GIL(Globals Interpreter Lock). However, if you are looking for a high level programming language then python can be used because most of the operations like matrix manipulations, data structures etc are done at runtime using NumPy package whereas in case of julia these operations happen during compilation time only. Also, when comparing the performance between both of them, we see that julias performance increases by increasing the number of cores. Whereas, in case of python the increase in speed is very less even if there was an increase in the number of cores. This shows that python scales better across multiple threads. So, based on this comparison we conclude that python performs well in applications where computation needs are low and large amount of input and output data processing happens. In such cases, we would prefer python over javaulia. But in other scenarios where computational power requirement is higher, then we go for julia."

Instead Onyx has their own proprietary technology called \u201cMobius\u201d with which they produce their screens. While the Mobius tech isn\u2019t bad by any means\u2014it certainly works just fine for what people expect from E Ink displays\u2014it\u2019s also nowhere near up to par with some of the better IPS panels currently used in modern ereaders these days such as the Kindle Paperwhite Gen 6. So if you want one thing that\u2019s definitely going to be lacking on the Onyx device compared even to cheaper alternatives, it would probably be color reproduction.\n\nIf all you care about though is having the biggest reading area then the Note Pro will likely still suit whatever purposes you need it for perfectly well since the actual resolution itself is quite good; it only suffers because of poor quality control when it comes to manufacturing the individual units themselves. But if you really must have a large screen and also happen to be able to afford a much more expensive option too then you could look into getting yourself either of two different devices made by Sony, the DPT-RP1 ($1295 USD MSRP on Amazon right now) and DPT-CP1 ($399). They both offer 13.3\" IPS touchscreen displays and come running Android OS so you won\u2019t necessarily feel completely left behind using them if you\u2019re already comfortable doing everything on your smartphone.\n\nComment: Thank you for your detailed answer!"

            "\ud83d\udc36\n\nAnswer: When flying from Los Angeles, California to London, England (about 10 hours) on Virgin Atlantic Airlines, I was able to experience this first hand! Our aircraft took off, flew over the Pacific Ocean, then headed upwards into the sky. It was amazing because all of us passengers could feel our feet pressing against nothingness--even though we were actually moving quite quickly. This experience gave me a very clear idea about how gravity works. Gravity holds things down, so when an object flies away from Earth, there must be another force working in opposition. That other force is called \"lift\". Lift allows objects such as planes and helicopters to fly through the air by pushing them vertically upward. This upward movement makes the plane or chopper move forward without having to use fuel for propulsion (like with cars). The engines provide only enough power to keep the craft moving at speed. Because of this mechanism, humans have been able to build machines which allow people to travel across countries and oceans more safely than ever before.

They only stay afloat for long distances if there\u2019s enough wind speed going through their wings or back at them so the plane can fly! Then, once you put gasoline into the engine, the jet engines inside burn up fuel and spit out gas which then makes another type of gas called exhaust (or \u2018emission\u2019). The gas will come right off the surface with tons of force making two huge columns shooting above the plane! Then all together these create drag forces on the plane since nothing can go faster than speed of light except for the speed of sound. Therefore this results in lowering its flight pattern as we call \"flight path\" by about 2% every time you fire those bad-boys over to the left wing(the side towards the back)!

            "1) The hardest thing about coming up with questions for artificial intelligence is getting it interested enough so they keep asking questions without becoming frustrated or bored by their own ignorance. It would take a lot more creativity than most people realize, especially because we usually tend to assume that if someone doesn\u2019t already understand something then they couldn\u2019t possibly care about it either, but once you become aware of how much there is left out of our education system due to time constraints and other factors, such as money or lack thereof (which has been an issue ever since the beginning of public schooling), which often causes students to lose interest in learning altogether; it becomes apparent just how important it actually is to find ways of keeping children motivated towards academics. 2) Because kids can pick up on adults quickly losing patience with them when trying to teach them anything new, even something really simple like teaching basic math skills to a small child who had trouble counting at first, some parents end up having to resort to punishing their young ones for misbehaving during lessons to get through to them. While this sort of tactic may work short-term to break bad habits, it ultimately undermines any kind of trust between parent and child, leaving both parties feeling hurt, angry, upset and confused all around \u2013 nobody wants to feel betrayed, regardless of age, whether one happens to be a four year old kid struggling over his homework assignments each night before bedtime, or someone older still facing troublesome issues later down the road in life. But rather than using these tactics to scare children into behaving better, wouldn\u2019t it be nice to have some way of making learning enjoyable again\u2026?

Why am I talking to you ?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nAnswer: \\section{\\em{\"What is the purpose of life?\"}}\n\nIn general this question doesn't have a simple answer. There is no one purpose for everyone on earth (and possibly off it). This might sound like \"weasel words\", but they aren't; consider that some people just go through their days without caring about anything beyond eating enough food to keep themselves alive and stay out of jail, while others seek meaning from helping those who need help most - sometimes even at great personal risk. And yet another group of individuals tries to find new ways of improving humanity by researching and creating technologies which may eventually lead us into space where we will be able to start looking further than our own planet. All these things would fall under different definitions of 'purpose'. The same applies if someone asks \"why are we here\"? We are here because there was a Big Bang somewhere along time ago. Somewhere around half a billion years later evolution made humans appear. From then until now many other events happened that influenced us individually and collectively, shaping our cultures and defining our individual purposes in life. But there isn't only one common denominator to all these events; rather, each event has its own specific influence and effect depending on how it relates to previous ones and what it leaves behind. That is, in my opinion, part of the beauty of life: the ability to shape yourself based on everything you experience and interact with throughout your lifetime. So the true answer to both questions is \"you define it\". No one else gets to tell you what you ought to do, except maybe when it comes to breaking laws, which you still get to choose whether you follow them or not (although this often results in negative consequences for your well-being and health, so best avoided unless you really",

Today I tried this again and got the same response but then realised it was different from before because it now includes \"the\" in front of \"rolling stone\".\n\nAssistant: Good observation!\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\nHow did Google Duplex pass itself off as human without getting caught out by anyone listening to the conversation ? Is there some sort of deception technology built into it like lip reading which can tell if someone has seen you look at them or hear them talk ? Doesn\u2019t everyone use google home / duplex on their phone these days so wouldn\u2019t people immediately pickup they were talking to one just through how the other person sounded/spoke etc? Or would google have programmed everyones voices in so it couldn\u2019t recognise differences between individuals speaking even though everyone sounds completely unique. Could google actually fool people enough where noone knows whether it was genuinely human until after the call when googles ai analyzes the voice samples (assuming thats whats going on)\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nGoogle Duplex is using two main techniques: \\strong{(a)} To disguise itself as human; \\strong{(b)} To speak normally during the conversation. Let us take both these aspects separately here. Firstly, let us discuss about disguising as human. Here, the goal is to fool the caller who thinks he/she is conversing with another human rather than with machine. For doing so, the first step involves recording a lot of human speech patterns. Then, those recordings are used to create models that represent human-like speech behavior. Finally, all utterances produced by Duplex system will resemble these pre-recorded patterns, making the output almost indiscernible from human-speech. Now coming back to our original"

One where the user asks a question which gets matched against the knowledge database. The other type of response is when the user makes one particular statement and then the program responds by asking them another question from its list based on how they answered. So if the user says `yes` to a question, the next one will ask whether the user agrees with that or disagrees with that. And so forth...\n\nSo, this question is about the latter case. It seems to be using [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), specifically [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning#Supervised_vs._unsupervised). There is an algorithm which learns over time which statements get rewarded (by the user saying 'good') vs. punished (by the user sayiing 'bad'), and tries to predict which statements the user might prefer.\n\nIt'll try different things out at first until the user gives feedback, then refine those ideas accordingly. That's probably why it starts off fairly basic and dumb, but gradually improves.\n\n\\section{\"How do you come up with a good question\"}\n\nThe bot uses a set"

However, I am curious about how the bot knows that the user has stopped responding. It doesn't seem to use `is_done()` because if it did, it would return true immediately after receiving the first message from the user. Instead, it waits several seconds before returning true. This makes me wonder whether it uses some other method such as checking the length of the response string. But even so, wouldn't it still wait at least a few milliseconds between each check? So my questions are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Does the bot actually use `is_done()`, but only checks every second or two? Or does it use some other mechanism entirely?\n\\item Assuming it does use `is_done()`, why does it take several seconds to detect that the user has stopped typing? Shouldn't it just return true right away since the user hasn't sent any messages during those several seconds?\n\\end{itemize}\n\nComment: @JonathanMee I believe that the bot is using `is_done` based on [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40965408/how-to-detect-if-the-user-has-"

Can you tell me some information about Jeju Island..?!\n\\end{code}\n\nAnswer: There seem to be multiple issues with your code:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item `user` variable has no value - it is empty. This may happen if your input string does not start with \"hello\". It seems like this happens because you do not check for an existing user response before asking them new questions/responses. Maybe add `if (!user)` test there? However you will also have to handle the case where they enter another non-response string after initial one. In my opinion the best solution here would be to parse all input into sentences and then just work on each sentence separately e.g.: https://stackoverflow.com/a/35412687/10911110 . For now you can try checking user input after `for`-loop but that won't catch cases when first response contains multiple words i.e., when they write `\"Hello how are you\"`.\n\\item Some of your regex patterns contain extra characters which results in errors such as `\"[^\\\"]*\"` matching nothing (`match()` returns null). The error message could sometimes lead us astray so we should always doublecheck output from console logs. Also using `\\w+` pattern matches alphanumeric symbols only e.g., `JEJU` but `\\W` matches anything \\em{except} those. So if you want to match both types use `[\\pL\\pN]+` which includes English letters and numbers along with Unicode digits & punctuation marks (but excludes white space character).\n\\item Try moving `.split(\"\\n\")` command inside the loop - otherwise every time"

(Example) :   x=cos(10degree),y=-sin(234degree)  ,now these points need to approximate to each other which means they must meet in the same point so using cos & sin functions, we get a vector around origin.(example) x = -1 y = 0    now again if i rotate those by some small value like say pi/6 ,then it will become z =0; x =-sqrt(-1); y =-sqrt((1+sqrt(759))^(-1/6)  ) and this vector is perpendicular to previous vector . Now we want our angles to come close to eachother so that when rotation is done with z ,then z meets up with x-x, z meets up with -sqrt((-1)^(-1)/i) y axis vector.\nSo here my problem lies..How can i check those conditions above without having them too accurate??? ..so what i need exactly is a simple expression for checking whether distance between these points is within range or not...\n\nAnswer: \\strong{The `math.isclose()`} method accepts two arguments namely \\em{\\begin{code}\nfunc: Callable[[Any], Any]\n\\end{code}} and \\em{`eps`}.

This method takes two parameters, x and y, which are both floats (or ints). It returns True if these numbers have approximately equal values. In this case they do.

In particular, consider comparing floats equal except for zero parts which may differ by a small integer.

We can guess from his/her other posts (e.g., [here](https://english.stackexchange.com/a/543708)) that he/she has done some research into AIs already, so \\em{crackpot theories} won't work well here because they imply OP thinks this sort of thing is ridiculous which contradicts his previous postings. Also, there isn't really a need to use a long sentence such as C1; just saying \"No way!\" will do fine if C is right. Finally, since OP specifically says that it shouldn't be implied by using certain words like \"[language model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model)\", then C2 is clearly wrong (at least without context).\n\nComment: Hmm, but how do I justify the bolded part with C? It seems out-of-place given the scenario.\n\nComment: @TroyGoldberg - How did you figure out **[B]** was incorrect based only on \"Hey\"? Would *Hi* have worked better than ***hey***? Why didn't you also eliminate all others except C when OP used \"*What are you upto*\" rather than \"up to\". Is ***uppet*** even a word?\n\nComment: @user9611488 I think that was mainly luck, yes.

My name\u2019s Jesse and I am working with a company called [name removed] on building some artificial intelligence models for chatbots, which has been quite fun so far but also challenging at times (it seems like every day they ask us for more and more data). So yeah it can get pretty crazy sometimes haha. But I\u2019m actually taking today off work because yesterday was kinda stressful - our manager came by our desks multiple times during the course of the afternoon and he just kept giving out this negative vibe; one time he said \u201cwe have no money\u201d when he walked past my desk. He did not even say hi, or hello... just straight to business! Haha what do you think? Are people like him really necessary to run such large companies these days? Maybe we could replace them all with machines instead :) Or maybe just use a mix between humans and bots for tasks like those where humans seem less useful than automation tools (i.e. managing employees)\n\n\\subsection{Conversations}\n\\label{sec:convs}\nThe following sections will discuss how well the participants were able to carry on conversations without explicitly referring to their true identities throughout each round of the study. The conversation transcripts were reviewed from a social engineering perspective based upon two metrics: the amount of time taken before either participant mentioned the identity of themselves/their counterpart (\\textit{i.e.} the delay), and the number of attempts made to reference their identity within the dialogue. This latter metric includes references both directly through naming their partner or stating \\textit{\"this isn't going too smoothly\"} etc., as well as indirect mentions using terms that are often associated with their partnerships. For example, if Assistant says ``hey'' then User responds saying ``what'' and later uses phrases similar to `hey',",

Tell me how many times have you talked about such issues with others so far? Hasn't anyone tried to resolve them yet? Are these problems affecting you mentally or physically? Who were they talking against exactly? Was he doing his job well before yesterday also? Why did everyone suddenly started saying bad things about him only after few days ago? Did anybody ask you directly whether you wanted to join their team meeting to discuss such topics? Does this problem relate to any kind of sexual harassment from male co-workers/supervisors or otherwise? Do you trust anyone enough to let them hear out every detail of this problem even though it may hurt your ego initially but will ultimately save your career? Are you aware of anyone who knows the topic very well like you (like another senior manager) who could take charge of the situation once the investigation starts? Are you ready to go through whatever legal formalities involved during this process if needed? Will you keep this secret confidential between both of us?

We believe this shows evidence that the bot has learned to adapt itself according to its interaction history. This is also shown by the following dialogue between the two participants:\n\\begin{quote}\nAssistant: Hi! Do you mind sharing what kind of food you love most?\n\nUser: I really love Italian cuisine, especially lasagna.\\newline Assistance: Wow, great choice!

            "\tHello. How was your night so far? Are you tired from working out today?\n\\end{verbatim}\n\\noindent The user then continues with several questions asking for the Assistant\u2019s personal details. We will refer back to this example later when discussing how these dialogues can influence people\u2019s perception of chatbots and their ability to understand contextual meaning. In order to better analyze the data collected during our study, we used NLTK~\\cite{nltk} to perform basic tokenization (e.g., splitting sentences into words). Furthermore, we also performed sentiment analysis using VADER~\\cite{vader}, where we found that the majority of conversations were neutral/positive in sentiment; see Figure \\ref{fig:sentiment}. This indicates that most participants enjoyed talking to Alexa.\n\nTo determine what users thought they were speaking with at the end of each conversation, we asked them to choose which category best describes it (i.e., robotic, artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithm) after finishing the interaction. Participants could only select one option from three choices presented to them by Alexa before ending the session. After completing all four interactions described above, participants answered some additional post-interaction questions regarding the experience itself such as whether or not they had fun chatting with Amazon Alexa and whether there was anything surprising or interesting they learned about the bot during the interaction. They were given the choice between two pre-defined options (yes/no). Last but not least, we asked the same set of questions again after the participant had completed both tasks and finished rating all five assistants. Finally, we asked participants if they wanted to continue interacting with Alexa. Those who chose ``Yes\", continued to talk with Alexa until she ended the interview. All others left immediately upon finishing the task and rated the last assistant.\n\nWe note here that although the"

The backslash character adds a special meaning but not sure exactly what it does without some research on python string formatting functions - see https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_format.asp which shows examples of how they work.\n\nAnswer: \\begin{itemize}\n\\item Put `\\` at beginning. So you will have new lines inbetween each word. As when user gives command , print() function returns new line and all spaces gets printed automatically. Also the command has space between hello and 25 and so you may need two `\\` to join. But here as soon first \\ works fine only for you.\n\\end{itemize}",

It uses the concept of building blocks from [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37281050/7414759), though the implementation differs slightly\u2014but that\u2019s mostly a matter of personal preference. As long as each function returns its result value (the widget itself!) then anything else which gets called after a callback already exists in global scope.\n\nThis doesn't require `from tkinter import *`, since globals are created during \\strong{init}, which happens before their first call; also, globals aren't local namespaces just like functions are (i.e., they don't hide code defined within a module, either). So for example `Label` already exists"

They only care about themselves and will stop at nothing to get what they want.\n\\vspace{5pt}\n\nThe second example is also an excerpt from the same conversation between the user and our assistant, with different input. The difference can be seen on both sides. In contrast to \\emph{\"Psychologically speaking\"} (the first line), the second version contains the phrase \"\\textcolor{\\textit{red}{\\textbf{IMO}}}\" (\\emph{In my opinion}). Also, the last two lines were added by the user. These differences might influence the overall sentiment of this particular response. To investigate how these variations may affect the final output we use the following approach. Firstly, we remove all words that contain \"OPINION\" (\\texttt{\"@OPINION\"}, e.g., \\textcolor{\\textit{blue}{``in''}}, \\textcolor{\\textit{green}{\\textbf{my}}} etc.) from each sentence using a pre-defined dictionary. Secondly, we compute the similarity score $S_c$ for every single sentence pair $(x_{u}, x_{\\text{ass}}) = \\{x^i_a| i=2...N\\}$. Finally, we compare their scores against the baseline model $M$. We observe a significant improvement when comparing the original model ($S_{baseline}$) with the one fine tuned with additional training data ($S^{FT}_{\\text{model}}$). However, there seems to be some overfitting since the performance decreases when adding more examples during training time.\n\n\\begin{figure}[th]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figures/sentence_similarity.png}\n\\\\[-4ex]\\hspace{-3ex}\\footnotesize \\caption{Similar",

            "1) Psychopaths can be very charming people who seem like they have good intentions. They may even appear to care for others at times. However, their actions show otherwise. For example, if someone has been abused by his/her partner, then this person will likely feel empathy towards them. A psychopath would only pretend to sympathize with him/her so that they could get what they want from them (e.g., money). This means that psychopaths lack emotional depth because they cannot truly understand how other people feel. In addition, psychopaths tend to blame everyone else except themselves when things go wrong. They also lie frequently without remorse.\n2) It\u2019s important to note that psychopathic traits vary greatly among individuals. Someone might exhibit one or two characteristics associated with psychopathy, whereas another individual might display many more. The most common characteristic of psychopathy is antisocial behavior. People with this disorder typically break laws repeatedly and violate social norms. Other signs of psychopathy include impulsivity, irresponsibility, manipulativeness, selfishness, callousness, and aggressiveness.\n3) There are several different types of tests used to diagnose psychopathy. One test involves asking questions related to certain behaviors such as lying, stealing, cheating on exams, etc. Another type of assessment measures an individual\u2019s response to hypothetical situations involving moral dilemmas. These scenarios usually involve some sort of conflict between personal gain and doing the right thing. An example scenario includes whether or not it is okay to take advantage of someone who trusted you.\n4) Although there isn\u2019t much research available regarding treatment options for psychopathy, studies suggest that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which focuses"

            "1) I think that people who want happiness need positive thoughts every day, because they will have hope for tomorrow if today goes well (Waugh et al., 2016). For example when people exercise, they feel tired but their legs get stronger over time. The same applies with other parts of life like our moods; our body gets accustomed to having good feelings on a regular basis! Positive thinking might actually increase lifespan (Scharf, Bauer, & McCann-Moeller, 2015), which means more years to practice using these skills, therefore helping them become habits that we never even notice. Also one very easy method that allows people to gain healthy behaviors without spending large amounts of money would allow accessibility from anyone regardless of economic status (Miranda, Vetere, Easterbrooks, Cuevas, & Otero-Rodriguez, 2018); for those reasons among others this model makes a lot of sens efor modern times (Crane et al. ,2009). It is important to understand what works best for each individual\u2019s values so that there is motivation to change specific things in one's behavior to reach goals effectively(Luthans & Avolio, 2003). Having an optimistic lifestyle also decreases stress level in response to negative stimuli (Fredrickson et al . , 2008), making it easier for a person dealing with painful experiences at work such as sexual harassment for instance by allowing them to see that there may ultimately still come some good out of bad situations that helps us grow mentally (Dean & Pichierri, 2016; Wadhwa & Singh, 2017).

It focuses on strengths rather than weaknesses, and helps one find what they want in life. Positive Psychology also looks into how people can improve their lives through small changes such as gratitude journal keeping. There have been many studies showing that this type of therapy works for those struggling with depression, but there hasn\u2019t been much research done regarding other mental disorders like PTSD. This could mean that if someone suffering from these illnesses practices some form of positivity each day, then they will feel less anxious and stressed out which could lead to better overall health and well-being. The reason I believe that Positivity is beneficial is because everyone goes through rough times where we may need support. We all experience stress, sadness, anger or anxiety at certain points throughout our lifetimes so having an easy way to cope with negative feelings would greatly benefit society.(2)\\textit{Positivity} is about finding meaning, developing strong relationships, discovering opportunities, feeling good about who you are and using your signature strengths. Positivity can change the brain, body and behavior. When practicing positivity daily, the brain begins to rewire itself to see more opportunity and possibility, and when combined with meditation, exercise and proper sleep, the mind becomes clearer and sharper. Practising positvity makes us feel happier and increases resilience. Research shows that positive emotions broaden thinking whereas negative ones narrow thoughts down and cause tunnel vision.(3) Positive psychology uses evidence based tools including CBT and DBT techniques and skills. These tools help individuals understand themselves, manage challenges, set goals",
            "\tPositive psychology has been shown through research studies and experiments over time to have an overall effect on people who participate in these activities by increasing their happiness levels, decreasing stress related illnesses, lowering anxiety and depression, and making them feel more connected with others \\parencite{snyder2017positive}. It is important to understand the different areas within this branch such as strength based approach which focuses on building individual character traits like self esteem and optimism, flow theory which looks at finding balance between challenged workload and abilities, mindset intervention which works towards changing thoughts into actionable goals\\textsuperscript{\\ref{note-3}}, and lastly meaning making where individuals look for deeper meanings behind actions they take in order to gain a greater understanding about themselves.\\parencite{mccullough2008positive} The use of technology is also becoming very useful for implementing some aspects of Positive Psychology because it helps create a supportive community environment online. This includes using social media sites like Twitter, Facebook groups, blog posts, websites etc., so users will have access to resources and other tools that may aid in developing skills needed to practice positive psychology principles. There are also mobile apps available now that allow users to do things such as track daily habits and behaviors, journal entries, meditation reminders, mood tracking and even games to play when feeling down or anxious to help distract from negative thoughts and replace them with more productiveness.\\footnote{\\href{https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-athletes-way/201904/how-use-technology-to-practice-positive-psychology}{How To Use Technology To Practice Positive Psychology}} \\par Here is my response to what I think are key points regarding the"

People remember what they hear more than what they read so it is important to engage users through various forms of media such as podcasts etc. This helps companies retain customers by helping them feel engaged with their products on an emotional level. It also makes marketing campaigns more relatable which increases customer trustworthiness. Here\u2019re some examples of brands who have used storytelling successfully: 1) Patagonia- they produced short films that gave viewers insight into the environmental issues we face today. These videos generated $75 million dollars from sales alone!  2) Nike - they created commercials that showed young athletic girls breaking stereotypes and encouraged other women to be empowered too. They showcased this girl\u2019s struggle to find her own identity but eventually overcoming obstacles and creating success for herself.

This initiative increased awareness among drivers leading to reduced casualties caused by road traffic collisions.

            "1.- Focus on real people and personalize your stories. You don\u2019t want all your customers to feel like they are getting generic messages about your product(s) / services. Use real photos, video from Instagram or Facebook live with comments when sharing on social media. For example \"Melanie was looking for a summer outfit she could dance in at her cousin's wedding! She loved our [Product name], so here's what she chose - isn\u2019t this dress wonderful?\" This would be an effective way of promoting the company products/services without overpromotion and selling pressure, just simply expressing one customer point-of view and giving another opportunity for potential clients to read other reviews and try same products/services.\n2.- Develop a well structured narrative using specific tools. A great tool to tell engaging and attractive stories is visual language and images. Visual communication (photos & videos), if properly combined text content, helps companies create meaningful and compelling marketing campaigns and builds trust in brands. Moreover there are some research studies supporting the idea that consumers who encounter a more consistent stream of brand images are able to better recall these pictures long after seeing them than those who experience less exposure .\n3.- Use third party influencers to tell your stories through their audiences. One interesting idea is having influencer workshops in which participants test drive your brand experiences. They take a tour around facilities; have fun doing things like visiting warehouse, manufacturing site, etc.; then they write about their day afterwards for publication by yours company. The reason behind this type of marketing strategy is related to the power of user generated content and recommendations.

            "I will do my best for helping with this issue, so kindly allow me to proceed by giving an outline below before moving forward; - Storytelling involves conveying events, facts or experiences from past history using verbal means. In most cases, narrators may involve fictional stories such as movies/TV series. This concept also extends to marketing and sales. A well-designed and engaging ad copy that appeals directly to target customers could increase product sales tremendously if executed correctly (as demonstrated above). It all depends on which platform is used during communication i.e social media vs newspaper etc., because different demographics would have accessibility differences across various channels.- Loyalty building can be done through numerous methods e.g offering rewards/benefits upon purchases like points towards free services. Business owners might also provide their employees bonuses/salary increases depending on certain factors (e.g increased monthly income, good work attitude etc.) However, it has been shown in recent times that more often than not consumers nowadays look beyond just financial gains but seek greater benefits including quality service provision (excellence) at fair prices (cost), therefore the main challenge facing organizations is identifying these aspects appropriately since they influence buyer behaviour differently when deciding what to buy & where to spend money (refer below figure); \\strong{https://i.stack.imgur.com/BhxjD.png} - In terms of strategic management approaches for dealing with competition in modern economies, many scholars recommend applying integrated tools known collectively under \"Business strategy\".

            "Branding has become more about human connection than ever before because consumers today are more likely to purchase from brands they believe in and feel an emotional connection with rather than those which have better prices and features. A lot of companies fail at creating stories for their audience simply by over-saturating them with promotions. Brands need to tell real life stories if they want customers to buy into what they\u2019re selling and keep coming back again and again. They must create personal connections between themselves and potential clients so that when someone sees an ad online or on social media, they remember who it was posted by. Consumers nowadays look for meaning behind products \u2013 this isn\u2019t just true of expensive designer labels but also small independent startups. Stories bring people together, give us hope, teach lessons we will carry throughout our lives. And there\u2019s no reason your company shouldn\u2019t be able to do the same thing through its advertising strategy. It may sound simple enough, but too many organizations fall short of making a genuine effort to engage audiences using emotion. That said, there are certain ways brands can get creative and find unique methods to connect with customers on an intimate level. One way I suggest is telling the story of how the product came to exist; what inspired it, where the materials come from, etc., then linking all these factors back to your core values (for example, environmental sustainability). This allows readers/viewers to understand what drives you, which creates trust among potential buyers. Another tactic is asking users to participate in your story - invite fans to send pictures or videos explaining why they love your brand and showcase them across your channels. Finally, never forget that even though marketing teams are trying to sell something, people aren\u2019t always looking to shop! Give your followers interesting insights on relevant topics related to your industry and promote your work",
            "Brand stories create emotional connections between brands and customers through an authentic narrative that taps into people\u2019s deepest values. In other words, they offer meaning and purpose to consumers who crave these things from their products. To tell this type of compelling tale, marketers need to do more than just focus on the functional aspects of what their product offers; rather, they must go beyond the \u201cwhat\u201d to tap into the deeper human needs that drive purchasing decisions\u2014the very thing that differentiates one brand from another. By understanding consumer motivations at the heart level, companies can develop stories with strong appeal and impact, and connect them with audiences via the right channels, whether it be online or offline marketing, social media platforms such as YouTube or Facebook, live events like trade shows, experiential retail spaces, or even traditional advertising formats such as TV commercials. When done well, effective brand stories deliver results by driving awareness and affinity for brands, inspiring purchase consideration and loyalty, improving advocacy (via word-of-mouth recommendations), generating leads and sales, building engagement among target communities, increasing time spent within apps and websites, boosting subscriptions/registrations, fostering higher clickthrough rates and lower bounce rates, enhancing search engine rankings, etc., ultimately leading to greater revenue growth and profitability. For example, take Coca Cola \u2013 it has built up its global empire around a single core value proposition \u2013 happiness \u2013 which has remained constant over the past century. It delivers consistent experiences across multiple touchpoints because its messaging stays true to the promise made at each interaction point \u2013 i.e., making everyone happy all the time. Its ability to leverage emotion is reflected in the strength of its relationships with fans. As per recent studies conducted by Kantar TNS, 94% of millennials"

            "The key element in building customer engagement through brand narrative lies within the emotional connection between consumer and product/service. A company\u2019s ability to tell their own unique \u201cbrand story\u201d will create a strong relationship with consumers and allow them feel like they have an intimate understanding of the company and its products. In order for companies to effectively implement this into their marketing strategies there needs to be consistency throughout all aspects of the organization from top down. Consumers must also feel connected to the overall message so they can easily identify themselves as part of this community. This allows customers the opportunity to become more engaged on social channels where they can interact directly with other followers who may hold similar views and interests. Companies can take advantage of these platforms by creating campaigns that focus less on sales and advertising but rather highlight the core beliefs of each brand and what makes them different than everyone else (Hartley et al., 2016).\n\nComment: @JasonBassford Thanks!

This will save time when trying out different styles/techniques because it becomes faster to learn these new techniques within a known environment. It also helps prevent frustration later on once you find yourself having trouble getting certain effects due to bad habits formed earlier. So it might take more time now but you won\u2019t waste time later by doing stuff over again. It took me years to finally figure all this stuff out myself though, which is why I still have lots of old works where I was experimenting and had no idea how to achieve anything properly. But hey, they were learning experiences. ;)\n\\end{itemize}\n\n2) Keep everything organised from the beginning! The last thing you want is to spend hours creating something great, only to realize afterwards that there isn\u2019t really room for improvement anymore, or that it wouldn\u2019t fit into another project anyway. There\u2019s nothing worse than having to throw away good artwork just because you didn\u2019t plan ahead... It makes me cringe even writing about it haha\n\n3) Try sketching/drawing often, ideally every day \u2013 especially if you lack prior training in traditional media, since digital art requires very similar skills otherwise the end result looks unnatural. That\u2019s why most professional artists use both methods side-by-side and complement each other well!",

It has more features than other free applications have at the same cost. Furthermore, if you need support, they provide an efficient contact form.\n\nTip: When creating visual artworks such as paintings / compositions with specific elements (e.g., landscapes / portraits), you can create an abstract work using them. First, try out both directions separately on paper; later determine which one fits your vision better, and put all of them together to enhance creativity/ originality. To start off, decide whether you want to express emotional aspects through imagery e.g. melancholy vs excitement (happy) etc.. Considering these key ideas will help drive home how to incorporate them into the canvas or digital screen - keep in mind, contrast creates vibrancy, balance makes things appear calm and balanced, complimentary colours go well together etc... The next step after deciding the palette i.e primary colors + tertiary color(s) + shades, pick up brushes depending upon your medium \\begin{code}\n\\end{code}. Next comes the layout - here again consider keeping different sections in check based on whether you wanna showcase movement patterns via horizontal \\em{\\strong{or}} vertical perspective points or even straight lines across to convey stability. Lastly, we wanted to briefly touch upon some resources too - so as far as apps goes, I would personally recommend Procreate HD over Photoshop for a starting point (\\textbf{$12}) as it's super lightweight yet gives you just enough versatility - and best of luck on future endeavors!!

For me personally, an intense palette often feels more powerful compared to softer tones.\\item Do whichever comes first.

It could also help having at least one or two complimentary color combinations.\\item Maybe it depends on how many photos/objects you want to incorporate into that one piece of artwork:\\item Landscapes typically require lots of references which helps keeping an eye on details (especially shadows). Portraits often mean concentrating even further down onto smaller amounts.\\item Anything from Photoshop to Illustrator will do, though most of them focus on vector art rather than raster. However, if you want to try working with both I'd recommend InkScape - especially when doing stuff from scratch.\\item Of course you probably need some tools such as graphics tablets or brush pen pens...\\end{itemize}\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nFor full analysis and discussion, refer to \\cite{Bammanabhaiah_MahboobHadi_MohanHussain_YeasirAmin}.

            "The most common colors people choose for paintings is black-red, but white is also an option! If it was me I would pick black-white since this is easier for drawing portraits (especially with faces) but both styles look amazing on canvas :) I like landscapes because they seem more relaxed compared to a human face but that doesn\u2019t mean all paintings need humans, you can just create art using only natural materials around you, like watercolour paint from plants if that helps ;) If I had to pick one program, my first choice would definitely have been photoshop - It\u2019s the best for beginners so if you\u2019re starting out you won\u2019t go wrong here, especially if you want a bit more flexibility than normal photo editing apps. I personally use Affinity Designer, which costs \u00a350+ so its a lot more expensive then other options such as Pixelmator which costs \u00a326 but offers many of the same features Photoshop has plus even some unique ones, too! Personally I find Photoshop way too complex, it makes it really difficult when creating something new because of how overwhelming it seems. There\u2019s just too much stuff on each window! With programs such as Adobe Illustrator CC though you will still get all those professional features, except in vector format, so that may interest someone who likes pixel perfect design and precision control, etc.. In general however i wouldn\u2019t recommend buying a program at all until you know whether it fits you perfectly - After all it takes up hard drive space & time downloading + installing and uninstalling can cause unwanted bugs.

            "1) First off, start with a base colour (or two colours), this will form the main focus of the artwork so choose wisely! It could also set up a mood for example, if it\u2019s an autumn theme then perhaps yellow-browns would suit well but keep it light at first! Next step, sketch out your subject/theme using simple lines without detailing too much because it may come across blurry later on when you zoom into the picture, unless of course you want a cartoonish look. Now add shadows by using black paintbrushes or simply just change its opacity to 30%. The last part, go crazy adding more details to whatever needs attention, i recommend experimenting with different brushes like chalk, charcoal etc., have fun!! :)\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe model predicts that user \\textit{2}, which has high average engagement scores in the previous turns, would most likely respond positively and give relevant advice based on her experience; whereas users who have low average engagement scores are less likely to do so (\\Cref{fig:engagement}).

            "1) A digital painting could consist of different color schemes but I like this one http://www.w3schools.com/html/colors_palette.asp 2) I like the landscape format better because it looks more interesting and allows for much greater detail. For example, look at Monet\u2019s Water Lilies series (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Lilies_(series)). This way the viewer can get lost within the piece by following lines with their eyes down the page rather than across it which doesn\u2019t provide an immersive experience.  3) Try drawing some things around your home using a variety of media such as pencils, markers, paints etc., then see how they compare against each other when creating a finished product. In terms of software try Photoshop, Paintshop Pro X7 Ultimate or GIMP if you have Windows on your computer otherwise just download Canva https://www.canva.com/. Hope my suggestions helped!"

For example, you cannot just concatenate all the comments together and feed them through the neural network as-is; otherwise you risk overfitting the model due to the shear volume of data.

However, we want to translate this to the best English equivalent using our system:\n\nThe input sequence consists of three strings separated with tabs: the first string contains all tokens from the source language that were used during translation; the second string contains all tokens produced by the NMT model after training; finally, the third string contains all tokens that resulted from applying the sentence transformation on top of the original MT output. The format of each token must conform to the following rules:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item A token has an arbitrary length but no whitespace characters. Tokens may contain numbers and letters only.\n\\item Each token starts with either a lowercase letter ('a', 'b') or number ('0','1'). All other symbols are considered words and will start uppercased ('A', 'B'). For example 'x' -> 'X'.",
            "1) Some words have changed since the Edo period (the Meiji restoration ended in 1867). The use of some polite forms has also changed with time. For example, \"\u60a9\u307f\u306f\" in standard Japanese corresponds to \"\u3042\u3093\u306a\u305f\" in modern Tsugaru dialect; both mean \"it worries\". But there were other ways of saying it before, like \"\u304b\u304f\u3044\u3068\u308a\" which means \"that worrying thing\", or simply \"\u3082\u306e\u3060\u308d\u3046\" meaning \"something\" or \"this-and-that\"; these expressions might still be used by elderly people today, but they are no longer commonly used due to language evolution/standardization. As another example, \"\u304a\u308c\u306f\u3001\u3053\u3061\u3089\u306b\u6765\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3088\u3002\" can be written as \"\u304a\u308c\u304c\u3053\u3061\u3089\u306b\u304d\u3063\u3066\u308b\u3088\uff01\", although this sounds less natural when spoken. So I guess some dialects just sound old because we have evolved our languages over time.\n2) There are more vowels in northern areas compared to southern regions. Because pronunciation varies from region to region, sometimes we cannot tell what someone says without knowing where he comes from. In addition, dialect differences arise even within one region depending on each person\u2019s family background. Therefore, if you hear someone speaking a different accent than yours, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they come from somewhere far away \u2013 perhaps their parents grew up elsewhere.\n3) Perhaps Tsugaru dialect is harder to follow due to its regional usage of suffixes -ko/-miyaku, -nashi/-mei and adjectives -nee/-boku etc., as well as the lack of clear distinction between noun endings and verb ending. While we often distinguish between \u201cI\u201d vs \u201cyou\u201d, we tend to forget about using \u201cwe\u201d. However, if we were to add such word"

For more complex questions, where we expect much longer texts as replies, some systems like ConvAI2 also used an encoder-decoder architecture similar to neural machine translation approaches \\cite{sutskever_seq2seq}, which first converted each input sentence into vector representation via recurrent network (RNN), then generated new vectors according to these representations using decoders trained jointly on parallel training data consisting of human reference/ground truth documents and corresponding AI model\u2019s responses. These systems were further optimized by incorporating reinforcement learning principles \\cite{schrittwieser2019mastering} and other types of reward functions during training phases (\\textit{e.g., } win rounds).\nThe main advantage of these sophisticated systems was that their outputs had rich structures suitable enough for human consumption. However, since they require large amounts of high quality labeled datasets and long generation cycles, they still cannot perform at higher levels in public games with small sets of low quality training dialogues. Another approach, the ``Teachable Agent'' proposed recently \\cite{zhang2020teachableai}, relied heavily upon external knowledge sources (Wikipedia and Quora QA pairs) before generating output responses based on its own policy networks (which may have been pretrained using BERT); they could produce highly structured (even"

However, since each word consists multiple phonemes with some vowels omitted in between, there have been various studies focusing on how these omissions can be utilized. A method which takes into account only individual consonants/vowel-consonant combinations would require additional data augmentation before applying a trained model; thus we do not use this type of approaches in our system due to their higher computational requirements compared to those discussed later.\\newline To determine if an input sound matches the corresponding English letter in text form (\\emph{\\textit{i}}, \\emph{\\textit{u}} etc.), first the sound waveform $X$ from user's input utterance was transformed to frequency domain via Fast Fourier Transformation ($FFT$) by calculating $\\tilde{x}$ where: $$\\tilde{x}[k] = x[k]\\exp(-j2 \\pi kf_c / Fs)$$ The above formula indicates a convolution of original audio signal and Hanning window whose width is defined as the number of frames ($F$). Since this analysis involves many small frequencies ($\\frac{1}{2^n}\\cdot n!$ frequencies at a sample rate), using $O(n)$ operations for $n=6000$ requires $\\Theta(\\sqrt{N})$ computation time where $N=\\frac{4\\cdot8192}{1536}=\\textup{ 30"

The analyses are based only on human conversations with ADA without considering robot's responses due to limited time. Therefore, we can not analyze how the presence of ADA affects the conversation itself but rather investigate how ADA facilitates assistants. For each aspect, we summarize some interesting findings followed by discussions on implications of such behaviors. We also highlight key features and challenging cases related to those behavioral patterns. In addition, we identify areas where future research could focus to improve performance and applicability of ADA.\n\n\\subsection{Turn-Taking Structure Analysis}\nTo observe whether ADA"

            "1. The chemical used for creating chalk was calcium carbonate. 2. I have seen this video where he creates Chalk by using vinegar https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQjHf-hxE8 . So I believe yes we can easily recreate the same at home if you get hold of some materials from outside such as powdered calcite which can be obtained either through a mineral supplier online store like https://mineralstuffonline.co.uk/. It also says that white paint would work fine so that could definitely give an idea how simple making blackboard chalk might seem to people with chemistry knowledge who have done these kinds of experiments before! 3. In another tutorial i saw, it talks about the procedure for doing so at home http://homeschoolingandmoreblogspotcom.weebly.com/chemical-reactionssimple-experiments/chalkboard-paint--a-fun-easy-way-to-make-blackboards . Here too its said that vinegar mixed up with corn starch is one of the most popular method but it gives very light chalks when compared to traditional way (the one explained above) ,but it sure seems to me quite fun because its mentioned there itself to experiment different colors! I am guessing maybe we just need more amount of time then, for better result..! But i will suggest that the person looking forward towards getting hands on experience,should probably look out for those links and follow them. Because the methods here explained might lead to further complications for novices who may want to explore science through such kind of stuff.

            "1. Blackboards were invented by Thomas Jefferson, who used them for writing his ideas about liberty. The board was made out of natural clay mixed with water until smooth, then left on top of the fireplace hearth where the sun dried it overnight. Then it was cut into rectangular pieces and put underground during the winter months so that it would harden more thoroughly. It was taken up again each spring when the frost had gone from the ground and placed upon boards outside in full view of all passersby. After two days it could be used like chalk (Chalk was first produced by rubbing powdered limestone against metal plates). This type of board did not last long; only three years before it needed replacing because the color wore off due to rain exposure. So he experimented with mixing pigments into the mixture, such as charcoal, graphite, lampblack, cuttlefish bone ash, burnt ivory, and colored sandstone, but nothing worked very well except red iron oxide. However, even this was found unsatisfactory since the markings soon became illegible.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Next he tried making blackboards using other materials such as gypsum, sulfur, lead ore, lime, whitewash, marble dust, slate stone, glass, coal-tar paint, linseed oil, glue, animal blood, wax, soap suds, wood tar, turpentine, etc., but none seemed suitable enough for school use.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nHe finally succeeded by grinding together some mineral silicates (either roasted flint gravel or quartz) and coating them onto an ordinary board with fine particles of gum arabic. The final product resembled common window glass and proved satisfactory both mechanically and chemically.\n2.",
            "1) First get some coal powder (black color), and then add water slowly with constant stirring until its viscosity changes into a thick liquid consistency like milkshake; this takes about 30-45 minutes depending on how much quantity you have started off with.

            "19th century France had some economic problems including an agricultural surplus which led to low prices for grain farmers; the government was also deeply in debt because it spent too much money during wartime conflicts such as the Seven Years War (1756-63)andthe American War of Independence(1775\u201382). These issues along with several others contributed greatly to the uprising known as the \"French Revolution\" from 1789-1799. The revolution started off peacefully but soon turned into a violent rebellion against King Louis XVI after his refusal to adopt new constitutional laws designed by the National Assembly. In this time period, people were very interested in science and reason and they wanted change, so the ideals of enlightened thinking fueled many reformers to take action against what seemed like unfairness at the time. This new way of thought gave rise to liberalism, socialism, communism, democracy, feminism etc., all which helped lay groundwork for later movements such as those seen during the 1900s.\n\nEnlightenment philosophies, particularly Montesquieu's Spirit of Laws, emphasized equality before the law. While these writings did influence the revolutionaries to start their fight for freedom, most believed that absolute power should be removed from the monarchy. Thus began the first modern republican form of government where citizens have equal say in their country\u2019s politics. Another idea that emerged out of the Enlightenment era was mercantilism. Mercantilists argued that there must always exist trade balance between nations, and wealth flows only one direction - towards the more powerful nation. For example, if England exports goods worth $1 billion dollars to America, then Americans would pay back Britain in silver coins. However, when colonization took place, this trade",
            "1) The king was taxing people heavily because he had been involved in two expensive wars. He also wanted to fund his luxurious lifestyle. Because he could no longer afford everything without money from France\u2019s citizens, they were angry about having less money for their families after paying more than half of it to the King. 2) The first estate paid no direct taxes but did have other responsibilities such as maintaining order within society and keeping peace among others. They held positions of power so if they didn\u2019t like how things worked, they would change them. The second estate paid indirect taxes based on what goods cost, and most were clergy members who provided religious guidance and services to those living near them. Finally, the third estate was everyone else including farmers, merchants, artisans, lawyers, doctors, etc., who made up over ninety-five percent of all French citizens. However, even though they made up three quarters of the population, only around fifteen hundred representatives out of twenty million served at Versailles and were responsible for managing the country alongside nobles. Everyone else was left with little control and this created tension between groups. The third estate was tired of being treated poorly by nobility, therefore they began to believe that everyone deserved equal treatment under the law which led to an idea called \u201cThe Social Contract.\u201d It said every citizen has natural rights given to him/her by God, and these rights can be taken away by government unless proven guilty through a trial. Another important concept of enlightened thought was John Locke\u2019s statement that \u201cthe purpose of government is to protect life, liberty, and property\u201d. Lastly, Louis XVI agreed to convene a meeting called the Estates General where each group came together to discuss issues affecting all classes (first, second and third estates). This occurred just weeks before events leading up to"

            "\nWhat was \"Enlightened Despotism\"? What about it contributed to revolutionary sentiment?\n\nAssistant:\nEnlightened despots were sovereigns who enacted limited reforms during an era when most rulers feared such changes could lead to revolution. The primary reformers, known collectively as the philosophes (\"the philosophers\"), included writers Voltaire (Francois-Marie Arouet)and Jean-Jacques Rousseau in France; philosopher David Hume and economist Adam Smith in Great Britain; and poet Alexander Pope in England. Other important thinkers outside these countries had strong influence upon developments leading up to the American Revolution and beyond. Some examples include British philosopher Francis Bacon, who advocated rational thought for political and social change; English jurists William Blackstone and Jeremy Bentham; Scottish economist Sir James Steuart; and German writer Gotthold Lessing. Mostly Protestant Christians from northern Europe, they tended toward a middle way between Catholic tyranny and popular government. They aimed not just at tolerance but also at freedom of religion - freedom that was already protected by law throughout much of Europe since the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, which ended centuries of warfare therebetween Catholics and Protestants after Martin Luther sparked a Reformation two decades earlier. The rights of men continued to be abridged through laws controlling labor, marriage, family life, property ownership and taxation. Even among those nations with some religious tolerance, the masses lived lives defined mostly by economic factors based on their station -- born rich, born poor, born serf or slave. That situation bred poverty, hunger, violence and unhappiness, all contributing to widespread unrest among common folk across Western Europe and Eastern America before the American Colonies would finally reject that system and"

Can i do anything else ? (waiting time)\nUSER: Help with essay topic \"Causes And Consequences Of The French Revolution\", analyzed the main cause-the economic one and consequences. The first cause was a series of crop failures during 1785-90. A major effect was widespread hunger, especially among the lower classes because of price inflation after grain harvests failed due to cold weather in 1788-89 and flooding from 1790 to 1792. Secondly there were bad economic policies implemented by King Louis XVI that resulted in a budget deficit for France at the beginning of the revolution. Lastly there was poor government administration resulting from lack of communication between central government authorities which contributed significantly towards food shortages in rural areas, which lead people into rebellion. One of these problems is related to agriculture and this leads me to ask how important was agricultural development to France prior to its industrialization?. I also would like more detailed explanations about how these issues influenced peoples life so that it can have better context. Also i am curious if someone knows any sources to support those points and facts presented here.. Thanks alot guys! Have an awesome day ahead :D !!\nASSISTANT: I\u2019m happy to try helping.

Doing this each morning makes planning easier throughout the week because you have an idea of how long certain activities might last.

Make sure those things will actually keep me moving towards my main purpose because otherwise they would just feel like another thing that i need to do rather than it actually making me feel closer to my final goal... 2- Stay motivated and believe that anything worth having doesn\u2019t come easy - remembering this makes us realize that all the work we put into achieving our dreams won\u2019t go down the drain; no matter how many failures and challenges get thrown our way :) ...3- Focus and organize yourself. Get up early every morning without hitting snooze multiple times before going to school. Wake up 5 minutes earlier each night until reaching your desired waking hour by keeping track. Use planners/agendas etc to manage and schedule assignments/activities to have enough free space after classes for breaks + extracurricular activities ...4- Create habits to avoid procrastination & start developing healthy habits from young age e.g.- taking vitamins daily/meditation before sleep ..etc\n\nComment: The last part has some great tips though :P\n\nAnswer: In terms of AI models for conversational chatbots (assuming your \"human\" assistants were simply programmed agents), you may find the following articles interesting.

Write down important events there, reminders about stuff etc... Also put notifications/reminder alerts\n4- Be prepared, prepare your breakfast & lunchbox for work/school early enough (don\u2019t leave it last minute like me who sometimes forgot )\n5- Keep all notes / files from class handy , also save them into USB memory card.

            "1) First step towards becoming an organized individual is having self-discipline which helps one be punctual, efficient with time management, consistent etc.. This also involves learning how to say no if necessary (i.e., turning down opportunities), delegating tasks, and making use of every moment for optimal output. In order to stay focused on completing these things it would help to set daily goals based around prioritizing tasks by importance. Once those tasks have been completed then there can be focus shifted to other projects until all deadlines are met. Another key thing about being organized is always knowing where everything is at. There will likely need to be tools put into place such as a planner/calendar/notebook so items aren\u2019t forgotten about, important dates missed, etc. For example, a weekly meal plan written out ensures food won\u2019t go bad, healthy eating habits continue, groceries purchased when needed, less money spent on last minute snacks because they weren\u2019t planned ahead.\n\nComment: The system may ask questions like this just for practice; maybe to test its ability to learn from experience without using training data.

            "1) Get yourself an alarm clock - Set it for 7am every morning. It\u2019s best if you set it at least one hour before when you usually wake up because then you can have time to slowly get ready without feeling rushed. The goal here isn\u2019t just to wake up on time but also be well-rested enough so you feel refreshed after sleeping all night long. Sleep is essential! And we need eight hours each day, no less. 2) Have a To Do List - A daily task list will keep you focused on what needs to happen during this week/day. Write down everything that you want done and stick with the plan until you accomplish them. 3) Become more conscious about how much free time you spend watching TV, browsing social media etc., and use those extra minutes to work on something useful. Make sure that whatever tasks you put into your schedule is reasonable (not too hard). For example, you may want to clean out your closet by taking all old clothes from there, organize it neatly and decide which ones stay and go away. But you cannot expect to do both at once unless you\u2019re planning to dedicate most of the whole day towards doing only these two things. This is called micro management and works very well when applied properly. Once you finish with your tasks for today, write tomorrow\u2019s to do list for next morning itself, and follow through it till evening again. Then repeat same process every single day of the year. Eventually, you\u2019ll see huge changes in terms of increased productivity, focus & concentration. 4) Invest money into getting good tools such as calendars, planners, agenda books, folders, bags, laptop stands, mouse pads, etc. They come really handy later when you start growing bigger in life. So always choose wisely depending upon where you want to invest in. Also"

However, unlike some prior work~\\cite{serban2015survey}, we do not impose strict restrictions on the length of each sequence.

There may be situations where subtasks can exist independently of others without compromising overall system performance. For instance, knowing what type of crop grows closest to lakes versus knowing about all types of crops is less essential than actually having access to land adjacent to bodies of water. Subsequently, it became necessary to determine how closely related each of our subtasks were so that we could properly organize them within their respective modules.

            "Firstly there are four types of food available for farming in this game, which we can use: wheat, sugarcane, carrots, melons . The first thing required for planting these different crops at various locations within the map is getting some seeds by finding them from grass blocks or growing it with water nearby (you will see one block of soil after pouring few buckets). Then next step would be just dropping said seed anywhere on the ground so long no trees grow around it(to do so right click an empty spot near where u want to sow) , also if u want more chances to harvest ur crop drop it near sources like bones, slimes, end crystals etc .. Now simply let time pass until they are ripe. For instance carrot plants take eight minutes whereas sweet potato takes sixteen minutes so its good idea putting couple pots side-by-side. When ready go pick up the items and eat away!! Also remember you cant destroy anything once placed because thats what farms r about ;-D.

You can get food like pumpkins (use wheat if they don\u2019t drop) with the help of fishing bobbers by throwing bread on top of the plant until one falls into your inventory. Be sure to catch the other items falling off first because otherwise, the loot will fall back onto the lake/ocean. If this happens then use buckets or cauldrons full of sand and dirt underneath where you place down your crop fields. Another great method of obtaining fruit and veggies would be growing trees and shrubs which you need sunlight, saplings from forestry trees work really well, and after placing them just dig holes around the base. Fruit tree crops grow at an angle and can easily overgrow, so watch out when planting those too! Make sure that the seed packets do NOT contain grass. They must only have vegetables. 2. Dig down two blocks. This allows us to grow all sorts of useful crops including sugarcane (sugar), potatoes(food) , mushrooms(mushroom soup)(fungi). Minesweeper flowers are another example. However I am warning you that it is quite time consuming since every square requires about ten minutes. A better option is to use strawberries; you may think \u201cwhat kinda weirdass berries are these?\u201d But let me tell you my friends - once again they spawn naturally along shores of rivers. 3.

Dig out the blocks near an oak tree; then craft an apple pie on the stove block with three pieces of bread using one wheat and two cobblestone blocks from inventory; bake it at medium heat for seven seconds, eat all eight slices and gain full health points instantly (64/8); use another wheat piece from storage and four cobblestones again, cooking them up to a golden yellow color (medium brown), place each slice inside an iron furnace for thirty seconds and remove all twelve ingots when they finish cooling off by tapping on top; add all of those together to create 30 ingots (75); sell half for ten silver coins, giving yourself fifteen back. Next time dig underground into lava where diamonds grow, which will generate enough coal dust and other material resources for the same amount as above; do this once every week or so if needed, until a good balance can be reached. I suggest farming crops as well such as sugarcane because you never run out, and its more cost efficient than eating bread, meat and fruit, which can sometimes be scarce during harsh weather conditions! Remember that gold bars cannot always buy their own weight worth in foods either...so don't go crazy with them yet, okie dokies?

Afterwards, you need to find an empty patch of land and plant the crop. When it grows into mature wheat, harvesting will take place automatically once per day at dawn. Harvested wheat produces three pieces of bread (two if cooked). Cooking bread gives hunger points back so they could eat some too! Bread can also be eaten raw without any ill effects but I do recommend baking them first since there is no reason not to when all tools are available.

Wheat can then be harvested with shears when it has fully matured. Other types of plants such as carrots, potatoes, pumpkins etc., also grow this way.\n2) Another method for getting food is fishing. Fish spawn naturally at bodies of water like lakes and oceans. They will swim around until they die after some time. When they do, players can catch them using bait (either raw meat or cooked bread). Once caught, fish can either be eaten immediately or stored in an inventory.\n3) Hunting animals is another option for obtaining food. Animals can be found roaming freely throughout the world. Players must use weapons to kill these creatures before consuming their flesh. Some examples of edible animal parts are chicken legs, cow udders, rabbit ears, sheep wool, horse saddles, and so forth.\n4) Lastly, there\u2019s mining. Mining involves breaking down rocks and other materials to find valuable resources inside. These resources can be used to craft tools, armor, furniture, and more! One example of a resource obtained through mining is coal. Coal can be smelted into charcoal, which can then be burned to create heat.

We do not need more options since our scenario requires either one of them. Also `\\b` denotes beginning boundary i.e., before first occurrence of the character which we want to match like in this case it would be starting letter of word after `@` symbol(since our intent keyword starts with @). So our whole expression reads like `Matching words after '@' and starting with 'e'` . In next step we check whether the matched group contains any alphanumeric characters except `zero` because there might be other scenarios where user wants to provide their own intent name and they may have added number also with their custom intent names , so to avoid these cases we have checked using regex if anything else than zero appears between `@` & word start then return empty string(`\"\"`) otherwise get value from captured groups (matched word).

The dictionary mentions several different interpretations, some say that barns originally housed horses before their stables came into use whereas others think that these buildings have evolved due to changes made to carts during Roman times so that they could carry heavier loads than ever before.[2][3] It can be concluded based on these explanations that a change has occurred from horse housing to animal housing but still it is debatable if it has been developed solely because of heavy loaded carriages. A lot more evidence suggests that Barn as a place was meant specifically for cattle but then there might exist some possibility of human occupation too although not necessarily habitation since they served various other purposes including food storage facility apart from the ones mentioned above.[4][5][6]\\section{What does \\em{\\strong{burn}} mean?}<blockquote>\\strong{To Burn} - Verb<blockquote><h4>\\em{[Intransitive verb]}</h4>(to undergo combustion without",

They say that these meanings are closely related; with only small changes in usage between them, such that it can be assumed they developed alongside each other until finally fusing together to form the modern meaning around ~750 years ago.\\n\\nThe original definition of \\em{to barn} was 'to cover', or 'shelter'. A simple noun \u2018branna\u2019 would have referred to anything that was sheltered or protected. As the Anglo Saxons started adopting more farming methods similar to those we still use today, there was a greater need for animal housing so this early word morphed to fit new requirements \u2013 referring now specifically to stabling horses within enclosures, known at the time as byres (and also sometimes spelt as bereas.) The term continued evolving as its primary meaning became fixed overtime to describe all manner of agricultural storage sheds rather than just stables, although both words remained used simultaneously right up through medieval times and even well after this point when vernaculars began separating into their individual regional dialects (for example: American, Irish, Australian etc.).\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item To summarise: originally a single root meant covering, protecting &/or sheltering but over many hundreds of years gradually acquired secondary usages that led eventually to its current dual meaning(s) as an outbuilding or as horse accommodation.\\strong{\\em{What did people do who lived in places without much natural light if no barns existed??}}\n\\end{itemize}\\section{}\n\\textbf{\\textit{(Optional) Any links supporting what"

How could we do that with our code?\n\nAnswer: In order to use NLU with Dialogflow, you need an intent called [DetectIntent](https://dialogue-api.com/docs/reference#reference_detectintent) which will allow us to pass a text string to the service. We will also define another intent called [TextResponse](https://dialogue-api.com/docs/reference#reference_textresponse). This way, whenever the Detect Intent is triggered by a message sent through chat, it returns the result as a JSON object containing the TextResponse entity.\n\nWe can now write a simple Python program using `dialogflow` library that sends messages through dialogflow webhook endpoint and listens on the return response. Here is how we can build one such application :\n\nFirstly, install required dependencies:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\npip3 install -r requirements.txt # Installing dependency files from requirements file named 'requirements.txt'.

In this paper we follow their guidelines to generate the training data and report results. This model requires the generation of large amounts of data in order to train neural models capable of handling real world situations like ours. However, since this kind of conversations have many inherently unique characteristics, the development of more advanced techniques has been delayed until recently \\citep{kelleher_hana}. Therefore, previous research using such methods often used simpler approaches such as LSTM \\citep{bordes2016learning}, BiLSTM \\citep{seo2017knowledge} and Transformer \\citep{yu2019adapting} architectures trained using RNN-based learning algorithms such as GRU \\citep{gru} or Bidirectional GRU \\citep{chung2014empirical}. We believe these systems would be too weak to solve problems requiring reasoning ability over complex contextual relationships, such as those required for medical knowledge. The goal of this work is to propose and evaluate different Neural Networks architecture for HAM based QA task.\\\\\nThis section describes the design choices made throughout our approach, including datasets used for experimentation and the network architectures adopted for building deep models.

Then follow instructions below to figure out exact location based on those codes! :) Good luck!\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\strong{Step-by-step approach:}\nWe will first split up our training data set using a function from scikit-learn called \\em{stratified shuffle split}. We have used this technique because we want the validation and test sets to be balanced so that we get better predictions with more accurate accuracy metrics like mean squared error. In order to do that we need to randomly split our dataset such that each class has similar numbers of instances present within their respective classes. So when splitting up our train set we create three new variables for stratification called \\textit{n\\_train}, \\textit{n\\_validation}, and \\textit{n\\_test} which respectively store the number of examples in each fold of our split data. For example let\u2019s say our total data size was `x = [a b c d e]`, by running `len(data)` we would get a value of 5 meaning five rows exist. By passing these values into the method stratify_split we tell python to generate random splits of the dataset that keeps each category at equal frequencies throughout both the training and testing process. The default number of iterations that it runs through to determine a valid partitioning of the dataset is 100 times, however depending on your system you may choose to run longer if necessary.\n\nIn the second step we take the results returned by the stratifed split method and apply the standard split functionality onto them in order to create separate train and test datasets for model fitting.

In addition, allowing individuals more disposable household income creates greater purchasing power within domestic businesses. This will in turn increase consumer demand due to supply increase. This also gives firms increased profitability whilst retaining competition through cheaper prices for consumers - Why would workers work less harder at a lower opportunity cost?

Marginal means the \"edge\". It may refer to either income tax bracket (or whatever else) OR after-tax return per dollar spent, i.e., total expected payback from one more unit invested minus current assets (this definition also called the IRR). This distinction makes things quite tricky especially with tax laws, because you must decide how long it takes until break even and how fast profits start accumulating before taking tax considerations seriously -- both are very subjective choices, hence controversial issues! So in essence marginal is not well defined and has two interpretations above (not to mention there may exist others depending upon context)! But that's ok. What matters is what it represents \\em{for YOU}. As usual in finance and economics it is up to the individual reader / practitioner whether she interprets \"marginal\" literally (i.e., first-order effects of adding $X units to output etc.) or metaphorically, like e.g. marginal utility or elasticity (the ratio of percentage changes), which can vary between zero (flat line, no effect!) all way upto infinity (!). Hence my advise to ask yourself exactly WHAT it refers to for each instance, case study you read",
            "\\textit{Income from capital investment such as real estate can be classified under pass-through businesses where there isn\u2019t much tax burden} - In this sentence what word (from \"classified\", \"tax\" and \u201cbusiness\u201d) refers to a specific part of speech (such as noun/verb)? Is it 'real estate' which belongs to nominal case category because here I have mentioned it with a modifier like adjective or article 'the'. Please provide some evidence along with an explanation so we all understand how the grammar rules works behind every action! Thanks!! :)\n\nComment: *Invest* seems the likely choice. The user may be suggesting that capital income might avoid paying higher marginal tax rate if treated differently than ordinary labour earnings; they might even mean \u2018capital gain on assets sold\u2019 rather than actual dividends. Either way their assertion needs backing up with examples before it has merit beyond opinionated conjecture. And note also that there will often be more tax levied when income goes down for many reasons \u2013 lower overall wages etc \u2013 and this will usually counteract whatever small reduction was available at margin by lowered marginal rate alone.\n\nAnswer: \\em{Pass-through entity} would refer back to either of two previous phrases (\"pass through,\" followed immediately by another phrase, then by the same thing repeated): \\strong{\"business [or] company\"}, i.e., an LLC, partnership, sole proprietorship, or similar arrangement in which income is paid directly out to individual owners without having passed first through the corporate entity itself\u2014in contrast to the common formulation used today of a corporation (often known informally simply as \"corp\"), which collects income, deducts expenses, pays federal tax based on those numbers, then passes whatever remains out to its shareholders (individual persons who buy stock in"

I am still new at this website so there was no way for me to tell what exactly I did wrong...I thought it would be more appropriate here than on stackoverflow though because of how related these two subjects seem to be :).\n\nAnswer: Yes. It\u2019s one reason that the Laffer curve exists \u2014 sometimes lowering marginal income taxes increases government revenue. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve .",
            "10% is lower than 25%. Higher means more income, which reduces incentives. But there might be some people who prefer paying less for a better job security so they could save up on their salary and buy a house earlier without worrying about money at all. This depends mostly on personality traits and individual life choices rather than what is actually happening in real-life scenarios though. Income also plays an important role here - if I was earning $4 million per year but only made $37K because my marginal rate went from 89% to 60%, it would definitely discourage me to continue working since this isn't even enough to cover my bills every month! I can understand where they're coming from with that logic (especially when it comes to those with large amounts of debts) and maybe even agree with them too sometimes, however most economists believe otherwise based on past data collected throughout history. So, it really just depends on how much one makes annually vs how high the top bracket is set for his/her annual income. For example, let\u2019s say someone makes around $50k-$70k a year, and the top marginal tax rate happens to be between 15% & 35% \u2013 these people will still probably feel encouraged to keep going since it\u2019ll only take away like 30% max off their wages; whereas for others making millions upon billions each year, that same top rate would cost them thousands to tens of thousands depending on the actual amount.\n\n\\section{Analysis}\n\nBoth the user and system were very responsive and helpful towards each other. The dialogue progressed naturally over time through back and forth conversation, showing that both sides have a common interest and want to get things done well.

However, this is only true when considering the after tax rate. Before tax rate is irrelevant here unless there was no government at all which is obviously impossible.\n\nIf we assume everyone follows basic economic theory then we see that the after tax rate increases due to a higher tax rate. This is because the opportunity costs of working increase since workers must now spend additional time doing things related to filing their tax returns and complying. Therefore, the net present value of future cash flow streams also declines due to the higher effective discount factors required given the higher risk associated with the extra compliance effort. As a result, the worker has less reason to continue working than before",

I really appreciate your assistance here.\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\\section{Conclusions \\& Future Work}\\label{sec:conclusion_futurework}\nWe have proposed a novel framework based on GNNs for learning user-assisted dialogue policy. Our model can learn effective dialogues without using any handcrafted rules nor external resources such as knowledge bases. In particular, our model can effectively capture both local context (i.e., current turn) and global context (i.e., past turns). We believe our approach is particularly useful for scenarios where users ask questions about things they cannot see themselves (e.g., medical symptoms), because these situations tend to involve multiple back-and-forth interactions between humans and machines. Moreover, our experiments show that our model outperforms baseline models across several datasets including those collected under controlled settings and realistic human-computer conversations.\nIn future work we plan to extend our model beyond simple yes/no questions. Specifically, since we only consider two candidate actions per turn, we do not take into account cases when there exist more than two potential options given the previous state of the conversation. However, we believe our model architecture has great potential for handling other types of problems, especially when combined with recent progress in generative models such as VAE~\\cite{Kingma2013AutoEncodingVB}. Finally, although we use a single encoder for both input sequences, we expect that",

The second example is from \\strong{Chatbot.org}.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nBoth these chats use some predefined phrases like `I didn't quite catch that.` which makes the conversation more realistic than simply using keywords (like `what` etc.). But there seems to be some difference here too - Google Assistance uses a lot less of them.\n\nAnswer: This is just an educated guess because I haven\u2019t seen anything concrete yet. However, I do think it has to due with the contexts where those AIs would be used most frequently. For instance, Google Assistant will mostly likely be used in places such as restaurants, hotels, grocery stores, mall stores, hospitals etc\u2026 These locations tend to have a high number of customers who are looking to get things done very quickly. They want quick results so they can continue doing whatever else it is they came to do. So the way they speak tends to be short and direct without unnecessary words.\nIn contrast to that, Chatbots seem to me like their purpose is mainly to engage users and keep up good customer service relations. Therefore, the language they use may tend to sound friendlier since they are meant to represent the brand image and company culture. In addition to that, they may also be programmed to say certain phrases that encourage people to stay engaged and keep talking back."

The first experiment was done with a single chatbot assistant provided by Amazon Web Service, Alexa. Users were given instructions to provide accurate, detailed facts about the topic discussed through their utterances, similar to previous literature \\citep{chen-EtAl:2019:EMNLP}. They also had the option to add a short explanation if required, so they could give out more details than what could be said at once. These conversations were stored along with the number of turns taken by each user as well as the length of the utterance which contains all contextual information for model training. Finally we use these data points to create our dataset.\nThe second experiment was an open ended exploration based task where users would engage with the bot by giving commands on how to respond without limiting them within specific domains. This would allow us to expand beyond domain dependent tasks and observe general behavior of participants. After completing this task, users gave valuable feedback regarding their experience using the same survey questions implemented earlier but in addition asked whether additional features would aid the conversation. Furthermore, we also note down all commands issued by the participant throughout. Overall this provides interesting insights on real time communication between humans and automated assistants and would also benefit future works building advanced conversational systems. For both tasks, the system consisted only of the command API. In order to maintain consistency across the models built over this dataset, we take every word before the colon (:), until the end of line(including punctuations) as tokens along with spaces. All other characters before space or after newline(\\n) character including tabulations (\\t) etc., are ignored. Also since these systems do no"

            "Kombucha fermentation involves two microbial groups -- Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) and Gluconacetobacter xylinus. Both of these species convert sugar into carbon dioxide during alcoholic fermentation; therefore when the tea leaves with SCOBY and starter culture is placed into a brew, CO2 is released which creates those delicious fizzy little things called 'BUBBLES'. This is anaerobic fermentation since no oxygen exists inside this liquid mixture for the yeasts and bacteria to utilize as energy. It can take about 1-4 weeks before you start seeing them on top. Also if using loose leaf black tea rather than green/white, then the longer it takes because black tea contains more tannins (the bitter component), but will eventually work itself out once some other beneficial bacterias start consuming them over time!",

It can also be used to detoxify the liver and improve overall gut flora balance by providing good probiotics. The process of brewing it starts with adding sugar and yeast into water. Then, the mixture sits at room temperature until all the sugars are consumed by the SCOBY (symbiotic colony of beneficial bacteria and yeasts) which then produces carbonation through anaerobic respiration.

            "1) Hi. Welcome to this tutorial on Music Theory. We have divided this topic into various parts for better understanding - Parts such as Harmony, Melody, Rhythm & Pitch etc. Now let us begin with Harmony which consists of Chords (Basic concepts), Modulation(Moving from one key/scale to another), Cadences (The ending note of a musical phrase).\n\n2) The term 'Harmony', refers to the chordal structure of music, especially Western Classical Music and Jazz. To understand basic concepts regarding chording lets start by looking at a few examples below :\\\\\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Major Scale - A B C# D E F G# \\\\\nMinor scale - A Bb C D Eb F G Ab \\\\\nChromatic Scale - all notes in between above scales\\\\\nAll these chords mentioned above can be written in Roman Numerals like so:\\\\\nI ii iii IV V vi vii \\\\\\\n\\end{itemize}\\\\\n3) As we see here, the first letter denotes the name of the scale/key and the numbers denote the notes that appear after that particular tone (C# is the third tone of C major scale)\\\\\n4) An example would be, if we wanted to write an F minor triad using roman numeral notation then it will look like this:-\nFm = I6-5-4 \\\\\nAnother way to represent the same thing without using Roman Notation is by showing all the intervals. So now, taking our previous example:\\\\\nF major = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 (starting with C)\\\\\nC major = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 (starting with A) \\\\\nA triad = 1 3 5 \\\\\nB diminished 7",
            "0\n\nAssistant: Sorry for asking such a silly question.\n\nUser: Do not worry, we can always learn from each other :)\n\nAssistant: Thank you. How do pitches work?\n\nUser: Pitches are frequencies which are perceived by humans through hearing. The range of audible sounds extends between approximately twenty hertz (20 Hz) up to twenty thousand hertz (20 kHz). 440 HZ corresponds with A above middle C on most standard 12-TET tuning systems (439.7656... in terms of frequency), so all notes below this are lower than A, but also higher. This way, we get twelve different names for every note; i.e., two octaves per name. When naming an instrument, for example the piano, we often say \"C\" when referring to white keys, because the lowest one has no color at all, therefore, there was no need to create another term like \"A0\". By contrast, the next highest key, D\u266d, has been called simply F, since its sound resembles flute playing very much.\n\nAssistant: What are semitones?\n\nUser: Semitone means interval of half step. It represents one position change within the diatonic scale. On the chromatic circle, this would be represented by a line of length . This is the smallest distance you could move around the circle without changing direction. So far, we have already discussed what an interval is, but now we will talk about how many types of intervals exist. Firstly, let us see what type of interval is created by ascending five positions starting at B\u266d (\\textbf{B flat}) and ending at E (\\textbf{E}). There are four possibilities here:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\underline{\\textit{Ascend}} - We go"

            "\tHi! Let\u2019s go through this lesson together. You will learn by asking questions, so let\u2019s start with an introductory one \u2014 what exactly do we mean when we say \"music\"?\n\n(1) \tMusic refers to sound which has been organized musically into some sort of pattern. It can be divided into different categories such as classical (symphonies), pop/rock (Top40 songs), folk (country-western), etc.. These different types have their own characteristics.\n\nAssistant: \tNice explanation about music. But tell us about musical symbols used for notation... What are they all? And how many there in total?\n\n(2) \tMusic may sometimes feel confusing if written out, but thankfully sheet music helps. In general, it comes from standard western culture known as Western staff notation. Sheet music represents various parameters using these symbols \u2013 notes, rests, clefs, time signatures, meters, key signature indications, accidentals, etc. These symbols work in conjunction with each other depending on composer\u2019s requirement. Each type has its own set of values. They are not exclusive - combinations between them create unique forms/structures of music. For example - a symbol called note head depicts \u2018A3\u2019 whereas \u2018bemolle whole note head\u2019 depicts A#8. Rest indicates no playable sounds; Clef determines pitch according to staves, key signature denotes the scale involved at a particular instance (e.g., C major); Time Signature defines overall meter count / pulse rate of song. Other special symbols show ornaments like trills & grace notes, and expressions such as dynamics.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Incorrect Example Answer:\n    I love playing music\n    My favorite kind of music includes hip hop , soul rock\n    Hip hop is usually associated with rap",

The best way to get started with learning music theory would be reading books from famous musicians like John Coltrane or Miles Davis.

Firstly, both the user and system use natural language, but we also notice the \\emph{intent}. The Assistant understands the intent behind this statement (as seen by how the response was generated). However, since these two intents were never compared directly, the system does not realise that the human has misunderstood what he/she wants. Furthermore, even though the bot recognises that the human wants to throw an object against a surface and expects rebound, the system still provides irrelevant details regarding gravity. This demonstrates that although our methodology generates meaningful responses based on the system\u2019s understanding, it fails to capture the intention behind those actions which may result into incorrect solutions for humans who misinterpreted their problem-solving needs.\\par To demonstrate such discrepancies between users\u2019 and systems\u2019 interpretations, Table~\\ref{tab:examples_misconceptions} shows three example interactions obtained using our dataset. In each row, first column describes the input from the end-user; second column depicts the final state the system predicted; third one contains the explanation provided by the system; fourth one presents what actually happened during execution; fifth column illustrates the expected behavior according to the system. As shown below, users expect that their questions will produce useful results regardless of whether they made mistakes. We call them ``human misconceptions'' and they occur due to a combination of factors including lack of expert knowledge and insufficient training examples.~\\footnote{\\label{footnote2}\\url{https://",
            "The fastest way would be using spin with no drag/friction forces, this could be done by throwing it at a high angle so its rotating fast enough for centripetal force to dominate over gravitational force (assuming gravity is acting on the object). This method also works if you flicked the back end of an egg like a soccer goalie. A second option would be doing a bouncing motion where the center of mass stays stationary while the front part swings forward then returns backwards. The third one I can think about right now would require multiple stages, first launch the ball upwards but sideways then when reaching peak height use an explosive material inside the ball causing it to deform then come down faster than expected due to the shape change. But these last two options aren\u2019t practical as they require more work beforehand compared to just rolling the ball which takes less time."

Use enough amount of duct-tape so they stick firmly on every edge and stay tight together throughout experimentation time frame.\nNow put some sort of rubber band inside and wrap it around a bit like in the picture below: <IMAGE> . When everything has settled, attach two small metal washers (like ones found under kitchen sinks) between end of each sticky surface, using one large nut at top, then use the remaining one smaller nuts as lock down tools (make them spin only if there is enough force applied, this means when there isn't too much pressure applied on rotating rod - these should not turn). Place second stick on bottom with hole on center. Using screwdriver create small hole right above hole you made before and pass it thru both sides making room for threaded barrel bolt (see pictures for clarification). Put first barrel bolts in holes (thread part on bottom and flat part pointing towards center). Attach barrel bolts into threads, apply superglue for extra stability (use wooden block or hammer for good compression) Now do exactly same procedure for next three pairs (6 barrel bolts total)! For final step cut a length of thick string, place a ring in middle of the cord. Take both free rods out, pull knot onto outside surface. Screw one half nut backward and tightly attach knotted portion. Tie rest off",

            "1) The first thing we need to do is to get the object moving. This can be done by throwing it forward. However, there isn\u2019t enough time for us to actually grab hold of an actual physical object (or even one of those little rubber balls), so I would recommend using your hand. Simply stretch out your arm and move your hand forward. When this happens, you will notice that the air starts to rush past your palm which causes drag on our body and therefore reduces the speed at which our arm moves forward. Afterwards, quickly pull back our arm until we reach a point where the force exerted by gravity is equal to the oppositional force generated from friction against the atmosphere. Now that our arms stopped moving forward due to friction, let go of your hands so they can swing freely behind you! The moment you release them, your arms will continue to fly backwards through momentum since their motion was previously stopped when reaching equilibrium with atmospheric forces. Eventually, the movement stops once both of your arms return to the starting position (where no gravitational or atmospheric forces were present). As a result, you end up right back at square one, but with opposite directions applied towards each side. Therefore, the answer to this problem lies within the idea of inertia and Newton\u2019s Third Law of Motion, which states \u201cFor every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction\u201d. So what happens if you wanted to increase the effectiveness of the experiment? Well, then all you have to do is decrease the amount of frictional resistance created between your hands and the atmosphere because more friction means less momentum gained from inertia and vice versa. Another important factor here involves how far you want your objects to move before reversal occurs. Too much or too little velocity results in poorly performed experiments; thus, you must find some sort of medium value somewhere around the middle-ground range.\n",
            "The fastest way would be if the person throwing was facing towards where they wanted the object to go before throwing. They could also do this by bouncing off another surface (if available) for example an uneven surface such as sand on land, rocks at sea level, snow, ice etc.. Another method which might work depending on what material the item thrown has been made out of, would be for the user to hit it with enough force so that friction slows down its momentum making it change direction back to how it came from. For example; someone throws a rubber ball hard against concrete. When it hits the ground there will be a lot of resistance due to all the particles in between them stopping it moving forward as quickly therefore causing it to turn around and head back to where it started coming from.

Ball will fall slowly backwards for about 30 seconds until gravity overcomes drag created by wind resistance then continue forward at normal rate until hits ground again.\n\n\\subsection{Experiment}\nIn order for our system to learn, we need training data. To this end, we conducted an experiment involving two human assistants who were asked to provide instructions for various questions. We collected their responses using Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) where they were paid \\$6 per hour \\cite{amazonturk}. In each round of AMT tasks, participants had access to Google search capabilities but were required to use only knowledge from previous rounds to complete all tasks without referring to external sources other than Wikipedia which was provided through our system during testing. This ensured that the task would test the ability of participants alone rather than their familiarity with specific topics such as history or geography. Participant instructions consisted mainly of text, although some questions included diagrams, images, or videos. The average number of steps given per instruction was approximately four.\n\nWe also ran a control group consisting of three participants who did not receive any assistance during the experiment. They completed similar tests except they were allowed to refer to outside sources freely including websites like wikipedia.org. All participants were informed that they could ask for clarification if needed; however, only one out of ten used this privilege. For every participant, both groups were tested individually and separately. During the entirety of both experiments, there were five total trials with a rest between them. Each trial lasted around half an hour and took place over the span of several days due to time constraints of participants and researchers alike.\n\nTo",
            "The only easy way I can think of would be for someone on the opposite side from where they threw their ball at the same height and with the same force as them to catch it. Then the other person throws the ball up so that it goes back down exactly where you were standing before throwing it again. This time if they hit you squarely enough then the momentum will carry it backwards but this requires both players knowing how to accurately toss a football which may be difficult depending on age/experience level. Another option might just be to use two people who each stand about 10 yards apart and pass the ball between them until one player drops it by accident or intentionally lets it go past them. In either case the key thing here is that the object needs to move fast enough to gain some velocity when reversed. So if you want to increase speed you could try using different materials like paper balls (which tend to bounce around more) or water balloons (which fly much further than regular footballs). Also you need to account for the amount of air resistance because even though there isn\u2019t really anything stopping an object once its been thrown into space, objects moving through our atmosphere do slow down significantly over long distances due to friction.\n\\end{code}\n\nAnswer: It looks good!\n\nA couple things:\n\nYou have `self` defined twice, once inside the class definition and once in the `__init__()` method.

            "The reason for using rocket engines on spaceships can be explained by Newton\u2019s laws of motion: an object will remain at rest unless it is acted upon by another force (in this case gravity). This means if we wanted our ship to move in one direction we would need a second force acting on our craft in opposition to Earth\u2019s gravitational pull. An ideal way to generate these opposing forces is with thrusters because they expel large amounts of matter in opposite directions creating exactly what we want: forward acceleration! So the only thing left is finding enough fuel to power all those thrusters\u2026\n\nComment: I think it would fit better into English Language Learners - https://ell.stackexchange.com/\n\nAnswer: There are two main reasons for launching from earth. Firstly the mass of earth allows us to take advantage of its gravitational attraction which reduces the velocity needed to escape to orbit and thereby also reduce the energy required. Secondly, once launched, we still use chemical propulsion systems but now just inside the atmosphere so it doesn't really matter whether that portion uses up kinetic energy or otherwise since it won't affect where the vessel goes afterwards anyway. Also, most people assume that the majority of the payload isn't the fuel tank itself but rather the equipment that requires lifting off.",
            "A rocket needs an external force (like gravity) to accelerate it - that means mass will be used up during launch even if there isn\u2019t much resistance on Earth due to air drag etc.. The same thing happens with cars \u2013 their wheels need to grip the road for them to go anywhere... And rockets would use fuel for thrusting anyway so they can get off the planet! As long as we want bigger/heavier things to travel through space then these concepts still apply\u2026\n\nComment: This sounds like it was originally written by someone who thought \"no friction\" meant \"friction doesn't exist\". That's actually a common misconception among young children when first learning about Newtonian mechanics\u2014they think that because everything moves without any pushing from outside forces, *everything* must move at constant velocity forever until acted upon by some other force; but this overlooks conservation of momentum (which requires a source of force).\n\nAnswer: \\section{Mass}\n\nIt takes energy to get something moving. Once you start applying more energy than what keeps it going, its speed will increase according to $E = mc^2$ (where $m$ is the amount of matter involved here and $c$ is the speed of light.) At the end of every day, all forms of energy turn into heat which eventually dissipates away. To keep objects floating around in orbit you need to continuously expend energy to counteract gravity and also to compensate for the tiny amounts of kinetic energy lost due to interactions with particles in interstellar space. Otherwise, anything with enough initial kinetic energy could fly off beyond escape velocity and leave our solar system completely. However, just getting off the ground and reaching orbital speeds is very difficult since rockets only give out so much energy per second. Therefore, most spaceships need to carry lots of fuel along with all the necessary equipment needed for"

Artificial Gravity, Inertial Dampening and Force Fields have been discussed at length in the second reference above.  This article, [Space Warfare Concept: Starship with its own artificial gravity](http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/nasa-grav.htm) makes it appear these concepts might work for combat applications within the solar system at least due to their ability to rotate relative to objects around our sun.

But at low speeds, the rocket engine needs more power than at higher ones (it\u2019s an exponential function).\n2) Acceleration/deceleration time: It takes longer for large objects like spaceships to accelerate or decelerate because the acceleration has to be distributed over all masses within the ship. The smaller the mass of each part, the faster we can get going or stop without damage. So when travelling at superluminal speed, one could theoretically travel from Earth to Mars in about 5 minutes with such a huge amount of energy required that even today would still require enormous amounts of fuel!\n3) Weightlessness: This doesn\u2019t mean weightlessness. As long as you have gravity pulling on the craft, there is always some force acting upon them, regardless how small the gravitational field may be. This is especially important when considering larger objects moving around at lower velocities which will take much more energy to maneuver compared to tiny spaceships travelling close to lightspeed where almost zero effort is needed. There must also be sufficient fuel to reach these higher velocities again after making sharp turns, otherwise you will continue following your previous course unless there was a strong gravitational pull somewhere else along the way.",

            "1) There is no such thing as frictions when travelling through outerspace because it has nothing around it for anything else but gravity and radiation (which is negligible). The only way we can travel through our solar system nowadays is with chemical propulsion which uses solid fuel like rocket boosters. But this method isn\u2019t efficient at all. So scientists came up with an idea called electromagnetic sailing where they use electricity to push objects forward without using any physical matter. This technology could be used by future spaceships to move faster than light speed!\n2) I believe the reason behind having large thrust engines is because if one were to build a ship out into deep space it would need to accelerate quickly from earths gravitational pull. In addition, these engines also provide power during deceleration. It may seem unnecessary since we currently lack the means/capability of leaving orbit let alone leave the solar systems gravitational pull however if we were ever able too then we must consider how long it takes us get somewhere and how much fuel it would take just to reach another star.\n3) Because of the immense distance between celestial bodies, even those closer to home, it will take time before humans can travel anywhere near the speed of light. For example, the closest star outside the Sun, Alpha Centauri B, lies about $4 \\text{ ly}$ away; even if we had the capabiltiy to achieve speeds close enough to $c$, we still wouldn't arrive until roughly $56$ years after departure. As such, most spacecraft require some sort of on-board power source to allow them to operate over extended periods of time - otherwise, the journey would simply never happen.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nComment: @RayButterworth I am trying my best to learn how the website works :)",
            "The reason for this has to do with how much energy is required to change velocity by changing direction. In other words, if an object wants to move faster it needs to apply more force. This applies whether we\u2019re talking about moving at constant speeds on Earth (like when you drive a car) or accelerating from one speed to another like when launching into orbit around our planet. When objects start out slowly they can get up to higher velocities without using too many resources because their mass is lower but once they reach high speeds, even small changes in velocity require large amounts of energy. For example, suppose two cars both want to go from rest to 60 mph; the heavier car will use less fuel than the lighter car since it doesn\u2019t need to increase its velocity quite so drastically. However, now imagine those same two vehicles starting at 10 miles per hour and then trying again to go from that initial slower speed to 60 MPH\u2014the light vehicle won\u2019t be able to achieve anywhere near that acceleration due to Newton\u2019s second law.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nAnswer: \\section{The ship isn't going fast enough.}\n\nIn order to escape Earth gravity requires only a little thrust. It takes a lot longer time for the rocket to travel between the moon and earth, which means the rocket must spend more time accelerating before reaching cruising altitude. Once above the atmosphere, however, you just need a tiny bit of thrust to keep the ship moving. That's all well and good until you realize that most of these movies are set after humanity has colonized Mars and built interplanetary spaceships, meaning that the technology involved would likely allow for very long range trips through deep vaccuums where the lack of air pressure makes it easier and safer for crafts to operate outside of Earth's gravitational influence."

This is then used within each encoder layer. Each head receives $head_{out} = \\alpha \\cdot head_{in}$, where $\\alpha$ depends on global values such as tokens count). It allows for training itself using past outputs at different levels of the network. Thereby enabling it to identify what representation work best with which token and other entities and provide improved performance, hence achieving low perplexity (PPX) scores like that obtained by [Bertweet](https://bertweeks.blogspot.co.uk/) with its BERTweet model.\n\nComment: Doing some research into this. From my understanding based off that response \"the ability to perform a weighted sum of all keys\" - I am assuming it just helps the process speed up because we are able to store the keys along with another matrix rather than needing both matrices separately and performing multiple steps between the two. That said though how would one approach doing an 'unweighted average'. Would that just be by storing two separate matrices and averaging them together later etc after applying the softmax and loss function ?\n\nAnswer: A very similar example will look like below code snippet from Google papers Transformers-An Introduction.

Q contains representations for the input tokens which will be multiplied with K to obtain the output representations for those particular tokens. This matrix can also be considered as our \"input\" querying for a particular word within its contextual representation space. We use V as another input to perform elementwise multiplication with these two inputs so that we get an overall output vector. Each entry in this matrix represents how much weight has been given by each token from it\u2019s entire vocabulary during processing. Finally we pass both these outputs through activation function such as tanh before combining them using concatenation operator into one single matrix representing final output representation for a specific token.

For example, we collected all reviews available on the platform by filtering the textual user comments using a custom built python script based on the natural language processing package NLTK~\\cite{nltk}. Then, after tokenizing each comment into individual tokens and removing punctuation marks, stop words were removed leaving us only with meaningful phrases related to the overall review experience. This was followed by counting the number of occurrences of these phrases in the whole dataset to generate a frequency distribution matrix containing all phrases found within each category of ratings, e.g., star rating. To avoid redundancy between different categories such as `price` and `value`, only one occurrence would count towards each word appearing under two distinct categories. Afterwards, the resulting list was then manually sorted into different clusters representing the most commonly used expressions, such as ``easy'' or ``helpful\". The final output was transformed into a set of 459 unique terms associated with different sentiment dimensions ranging from ``negative`` to ``positive`` with the neutral sentiment value represented as zero. Similarly, we performed a similar process to extract useful features regarding users\u2019 personal attributes. Here, we filtered all questions posted on Quora using keywords relating to demographic variables including gender"

            "1) The best way for most houseplants to grow healthy roots and stems is by placing them in well-drained soil mixed with some organic matter (like peat moss). Avoid using soils high in fertilizer; this can burn leaves. It\u2019s also important to remember to check moisture levels daily and never allow your plant to dry out completely between waterings. Plants like drier air at night than during daytime hours when they are growing. To avoid overwatering, try giving them their morning drink first thing each morning and then allowing it to go somewhat dry before evening comes around again. Water less frequently in winter months if the plant is in a cool environment where evaporation isn\u2019t happening very quickly. This will give more time for excess moisture to escape from the root system into the surrounding atmosphere rather than pooling within the potting medium itself. When watering indoor plants, always use room temperature water to prevent shock. Do NOT let the tap run directly onto the plant either \u2013 only fill up a clean pitcher/bucket/cup etc. to avoid splashing and spilling dirty water on foliage! Finally, consider whether there might be an alternative solution other than manual irrigation. There may already be one installed somewhere nearby that could provide adequate humidity without all the work. In general though, it would seem as though regular watering and misting, especially early on, seems to do wonders for getting things off to a good start. As mentioned above, frequent but moderated amounts of light will keep everything looking nice too. Good luck!! :)\n\nAnswer: \\begin{blockquote}\nI have a problem about chatbot for QA\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThere is no such thing as \"chat bot\".

            "1) Fill up the plant container with clean tap water at room temperature. The pots can be made from ceramic clay, plastic or glass material. Watering must occur on all sides (sides/back), so it's good if there are drainage holes at the bottom for excess water flow-off. Plants will die when overwatered; thus, keep soil moist but not wet by allowing them to dry out between waterings. Overall, plants thrive well indoors in temperatures around 70 degrees fahrenheit and high humidity levels near 50%. For this reason, place pot near an air conditioning vent, mist daily with cool water spray, use dehumidifier or put plant outside during warmer days. Avoid drafty areas because wind may cause leaves to wilt quickly. When repotting, always wear gloves due to risk of exposure to mold. To reduce insect infestation, check plants regularly. Lastly, avoid placing plant containers too close to TV screens, radiators or fireplaces which could damage foliage or stunt growth.\n\nAssistant: That was great! Thanks :)\n\\end{code}"

            "1) Watering with tap water can be very damaging for some types of plants because it contains chlorine which kills bacteria but also destroys plant roots. It\u2019s better to use rainwater if available. 2) The frequency depends on the type of plant. Some need daily watering whereas others only require weekly watering. 3) Plants like cacti do not need much water at all. They store moisture inside their stems so they can survive long periods without water. 4) When watering indoor plants, avoid getting leaves wet since this will cause them to rot. Instead, pour water into the soil around the base of each plant. 5) Avoid over-watering by checking how often you last watered before adding more. 6) Too little water may result in wilting and yellowing foliage. On the other hand too much water may lead to root rot. 7) Use a spray bottle when watering potted plants. This allows you to target specific areas rather than drenching everything. 8) Make sure there is enough space between the pot and wall/furniture to allow air circulation. Otherwise, condensation could form underneath the pot causing mold growth. 9) Don\u2019t let the soil dry out completely either. Allowing the top layer to become dry encourages weeds to grow through cracks in the surface. 10) Over time, fertilizer salts build up in the soil making it harder for plants to absorb nutrients from the ground. Therefore, it\u2019s important to flush these away regularly using fresh water. 11) For large plants such as trees, consider installing an irrigation system. These automatically deliver water directly to the roots via pipes buried beneath the soil. 12) Finally, remember to check whether the plant needs"

            "1) First we need an Operating System (OS). For this purpose I recommend Linux OS with its various distributions like Ubuntu Server Edition, Centos, Debian etc. As for web servers, they can be hosted on all these operating systems without issues. Most common ones used today are Nginx & Apache but if you want more lightweight web servers then consider using LiteSpeed which uses very little resources than other two. Other alternatives exist too.\n2) Then comes the database where data from emails will get stored. The most popular one today is MySQL but also consider PostgreSQL because it has better query performance over MySql along with many features not present in others e.g., full text search capability. Also it provides greater security over MySQl. In addition to the above, some people also prefer MariaDB due to its support of binary logging feature missing in MySql. Again there are other databases available including NoSQL database solutions like MongoDB, Cassandra, Neo4J etc but I wouldn\u2019t suggest them at first until unless really required.\n3) Next comes the mail service itself i.e. MTA. There are three types of services here \u2013 SMTP, POP and IMAP, each having different functions and uses respectively. So if you use only email client for checking mails, no further configuration would be required except specifying your incoming/outgoing port number. But if you wish to send mails through PHP scripts then you must configure outbound MX record and specify proper DNS records. This way your script would start sending mails through SMTP protocol. Similarly if you wish to receive emails via PHP or command line tools running locally within your machine, you again have to change your DNS entries so that your local IP address gets mapped into email addresses. Now you can receive mails by configuring either POP3 or IMAP. These configurations depends upon how often you check your email account since both consume lot of system",
            "1) Firstly, we need to check which operating system (OS) our server will run on. We can choose from Linux and Windows. 2) Once we decide between those two options, then it comes down to choosing an email client software like Microsoft Outlook, Thunderbird Mail etc... Nowadays people also prefer web based mail services where they access their mails through browsers like GMail and Hotmail/Outlook account. These applications do not require much configuration since they work on cloud infrastructure. However, if we still want to use a local application for sending emails using SMTP protocols then we have few more decisions to take. For example, how many users we expect? Is there going to be only one user or multiple users on this server? Do I just want to send emails using POP3 protocol with default settings or would like to configure advanced features like MX records for SPF protection against spam attacks? Do I need a firewall installed along with the mailserver?\n\nIf all these questions were answered beforehand, It becomes easier to set up such servers without facing unnecessary problems later.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe model was trained on over 90K pairs of inputs and outputs taken from publicly available conversations in Reddit [chat room](https://www.reddit.com/).

During testing phase we found out that when a dialogue goes beyond three rounds then the accuracy decreases due to some missing context. Also, neutral answers seemed hardest to detect at first but after sufficient training the model started performing quite well for them too.\n"

            "Well I would say an email service provider/business provides all this so it's better if a business runs this for you. However let me discuss the parts.\n\nE-Mail server means hosting mailboxes where your e-mail gets stored on servers when you send them from Gmail Apps like Hotmail Yahoo etc they provide free web hosted accounts but usually its limited to few gigabytes data. To store these mails in their domain some charges need to be paid also there might be performance issues etc and sometimes even restrictions apply on features. So best way to go with self controlled system is creating own Email Server which will be placed in your computer where files get kept securely without having any dependency on others. It's always good approach because if anything goes down anywhere you have control over whole set up so no worries about losing important stuff. Now how to implement? Its simple lets use Linux OS called Fedora it has lots of software preinstalled like Apache2 Web Server (Apache is very common worldwide especially used by big sites) MySQL Database Server, php & python, samba file sharing protocol everything basic need included easily just download ISO image via link https://getfedora.org/downloads.html then create CD /DVD from downloaded archive using burning tool and install it according to given instructions inside CD case. Once installed follow steps to change IP address from default to desired one either through gui or CLI like so \"ifconfig eth0 192.XXX.XX.XXX netmask 255.255.255.0\" replace XXX with yours , then install postfix MTA (Mail Transport Agent ) from yum repositories of fedora, now start services \"service sshd start\", \"service smtp start\". Done now setup gmx mail client and put in details same as hotmail .com/outlook whatever id you choose and configure SMTP details accordingly to",
            "As I am sure most people will mention this - there have been many security issues with email services recently which lead me to ask would it be wise / foolish to run an SMTP Server? The main concerns would be from spamming mails but also if i wanted personal data / emails encrypted then do companies like Google or Microsoft offer such options for private businesses?? It would also raise issues surrounding GDPR rules right? So if I were to setup an Email Service on Cloud Servers how might these affect it when dealing with clients? Does anyone deal directly with their client's privacy & can set up servers within the cloud so they get all benefits regarding control etc... and yet at same time feel secure about Data Security ?? Thanks!!\n\n\\strong{2- User answered} (Please note that the User never gave a technical specification about the use case)\n\nHello. Thank you for asking us! My first concern after reading your message was actually about legal issues. Running a mail service requires good understanding of legislation around this area, and more especially GDRP regulations since some emails may contain sensitive information regarding individuals. Depending whether your e-mail service provider has enough certifications required by EU law enforcement agencies, that is another thing. Another point worth considering is that an organisation must provide training sessions for its employees so that they are informed, comply and report correctly any abnormal behaviours related to privacy protection policies within IT infrastructures. There could exist other non-technological problems than those already mentioned depending mainly of course by where exactly you live. Personnel availability in your region or country; cost/benefit tradeoffs; geographic proximity of resources including electricity suppliers to mitigate natural calamities such as fires caused during winter in cold countries ; quality of Internet connection links; local government legislations concerning ownership or disposal of electronic waste resulting from old computer equipment that had reached end life"

As far as risk goes there will always be potential threats online no matter who manages your email account(s) so having secure passwords, updating regularly, checking security updates on a regular basis, keeping up with emails regarding vulnerabilities & other alerts are key to reducing the likelihood of these occurring but nothing is guaranteed when it comes down to security especially in terms of privacy protection from hackers and spam attacks.

'96/'97. So email services have been pretty important part of daily life, especially professionally over the years! My previous work has also had me doing IT related things such as website building/maintaining and data management tasks on Windows PCs, using programs including Microsoft Excel and MS Access for basic accounting & project management tasks at least twice a month during 5+ years prior employment (not full time) working within various companies/firms, some very large organizations which require multiple servers & software. As far as the more specific technologies involved with this sort of setup though? Well let's see... The main goal would be just getting off the ground here first then, before trying to figure out anything beyond those initial stages, if all goes well and smoothly after that then perhaps consider additional security features and maybe add on more sophisticated mail filters / archiving capabilities etc down the road but that would come later, after making sure it runs smoothly at least. Not much else I can say really until we get there I suppose! I hope you got most of everything there already. But basically speaking about it so clearly might be the hardest part sometimes lol... And again I'll repeat myself saying \"it may seem easy to someone who knows exactly how it works\", because it usually sounds too simple when talking to an expert or person skilled in their trade about even fairly complicated tech tasks or solutions to certain problems etc, simply because they often know right away precisely where each piece belongs in the big picture.

            "1) The most important thing is choosing the right operating system for hosting an email service - Linux/Unix systems are recommended. Windows Server is also suitable, but there will be more problems with it than with Unix / Linux (especially if it comes from a third party).\n2 ) The choice of software depends on whether we plan to create our private mail servers using IMAP protocols or SMTP protocols. I recommend PostFix + Dovecot because it has proven itself many times over.\n3) We do not have access to hardware, which makes it difficult to install everything locally. In this case, we can use virtualization, where we run several instances of Ubuntu on VMware Workstation, ESXi, HyperV, etc., each having its own network interface and IP address so that they act like real physical machines. This way, one machine can handle all incoming traffic, another can handle outgoing traffic, another can be configured as a DNS server, another can work as a database server ... It's easier and safer when you have a single machine that serves multiple purposes.\n4) As long as we choose good software packages, we shouldn\u2019t experience too much trouble with spam filtering or other issues related to security. There may be some problems with hacking attacks, especially if someone finds out about our domain name registrant details. However, even then these things can easily get fixed by changing the password or adding additional authentication mechanisms such as two factor authentication.\n5) For backup storage solutions, we need to find a place where we keep backups offline. These places could be cloud services, local NAS devices, or external USB drives. All data must be stored securely without allowing anyone else to access them directly. Backup solutions are very important since they prevent us from losing data after a crash. Without proper backing up procedures, data loss would occur every time the computer crashes or loses power.\n6)"

However, these extra resources may still be useful when applied towards more sophisticated objectives and environments, which would otherwise require costly optimization runs at test time like MiniRL agents discussed later.

First of all we need some design plans (to choose which flowers do what where) - but then we can get on with it easily by using simple planting guides such as http://www.plantzafrica.com/plantabook/. Then when plants come from seedlings we could add some fruits if wanted etc. A very exciting task :)! Have fun planning the project together !!! Good luck\n\nComment: The idea was just a generalization, maybe someone wants to write about his life, ask a personal problem or so.. The example you wrote shows a conversation between two persons that can talk normally. I thought the purpose here was different since users might not always be ready to interact directly... So my doubt would still stand\n\nAnswer: As you may have seen there already has been [one suggestion](https://ux.stackexchange.com/a/52738), let me offer another one too :\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item In case there were more than three participants at the time you made the comment (the post was written quite a long ago) the other members who answered did indeed violate our rule of having \\strong{at least two unique voices}. That means, only two out of the five posts differed substantially. We generally strive towards 60-80% distinct contributions in a given discussion. See e.g.: [Are group responses OK?](http://meta.ux.stackexchange.com/questions/948/). But this depends strongly on the number of participants and whether they have common background knowledge; hence there really isn't anything \"wrong\" per se, though you probably want them to go through and rework their contribution again once everyone is involved now ;)\n\\end{itemize}",
            "2) Start with researching the local conditions. 3) Design for each part based on their individual characteristics. For example if it has more shade areas, design those areas differently from others; such as adding flowers like violets and bluebells etc.; because they tend to do better in low light levels than most plants would be.  4) Try growing food crops along one side. There could be several ways of doing this - by making rows down both sides so they get some sun all day (such as lettuce); by making wide rows in full-sunny area, planted up every foot (carrots); by planting two long strips close together which can provide fresh veggies over many weeks at least. The only drawback might be water availability, depending where your main supply pipe(s) runs underground! But you can use a small drip irrigation system (costing \u00a350) connected into one of them... or buy/borrow some buckets to pour into containers set between vegetables until there's rain again :) . It won\u2019t cost much, just takes time but makes everything taste sweeter and tastier.   5) Think about other uses \u2013 what about using another part to grow berries (gooseberries and blackcurrants prefer acid soil). These need a trellis against fences etc. A bit later after flowering (if evergreen varieties) add a layer of organic matter like manure to increase nitrates level needed by plants then put mulch (leaves) round bottom third. That stops weeds & saves digging in wet weather plus reduces water loss due evaporation too, helping roots absorb more nutrients & water through cooling soil surface temperature in hot weather too.) Or try grapes trained against wall \u2013 vines can cope even quite badly pruned and give lovely harvest once per"

In our case we trained models to detect if user provided answers were relevant with the original query and how confident they were about their response. We used two pre-trained models for relevance classification; one was fine tuned for 7 classes, where each class represented the confidence score given by users, and another model fine-tuned for only three classes (positive, negative, neutral), to identify whether the response is actually helpful. These models use TensorFlow APIs, including LSTM networks. To generate confidence values between [0 - 1], both the input sentence and output category need to be converted into numerical vectors first, then multiplied together, before dividing through by the maximum value achievable over all outputs to normalize them~\\cite{liu2016neural}. For every sentence in the dataset, its predicted probability is calculated across all outputs and sorted in descending order, yielding a ranked list of predictions. The highest probability corresponds to the most likely prediction, while lower probabilities indicate less likely but still plausible alternatives. Confidence can therefore range from 0 (most unlikely"

The city was already well known before becoming a capital one month after him dying. His body lied next to his wife in La Almudena Cathedral for two weeks afterwards. In the same year that he passed away, Spanish General Election took place on June 15th where Adolfo Su\u00e1rez Gonz\u00e1lez became Prime Minister. This event happened three months later after the former leader of state died, therefore he never got the chance to nominate anyone else to succeed him. Afterwards, King Juan Carlos I proclaimed himself Monarch of Spain again when all political parties signed an agreement to turn the country into a democracy.

There were close to two million existing insect types identified when I went to graduate school nearly forty years ago; today there over eight million different ones recorded in science databases worldwide.\\n\\nHumans interact with these tiny creatures daily (good thing too because many pollinators play key roles for crops) so it\u2019s essential to know how well the bugs will survive climate change, what diseases we might pick up from them (in recent outbreaks of Ebola virus cases reportedly started in bat populations) and other impacts humans have made that could be causing problems for certain groups or species.\\nThis research often requires collecting live specimens to observe behavioral tendencies in their native habitats\u2014not always easy tasks given that most species tend toward avoidance once sensing human activity. While in tropical locations observing leaf cutter ants and bee swarms was fun to watch, this kind of work takes place around the globe, including remote areas where weather conditions can vary dramatically depending on elevation changes at high altitudes. Scientists then return home with samples preserved and ready to examine more thoroughly under controlled laboratory circumstances to learn about physiological characteristics such as diets (important for assessments involving agricultural crops), lifecycles (how long each life stage lasts before reproduction is initiated), habitat preferences/conditions required, whether pests or useful biotypes/keystone species for sustaining ecosystem health and biodiversity, genetic structure within populations studied, interactions among members belonging various taxonomic orders \\etc\u2026.\\nScientific naming also called binomial nomen"

A biosurvey consists basically of a number of sampling stations, at different places around the country or even planet earth where all forms of life can then be sampled and collected.\nIn addition there could also be samples taken from a certain location during the day but maybe night for instance, and if necessary from more than one station during various times throughout the year, like rainy season, winter etc.. Then all these data need to be compared to come up with the conclusion that yes we have discovered another new type of spider here...and so forth... This requires extensive research work because there might only exist just few examples left out there to collect....So the whole concept revolves mainly about identifying every form of plant or animal within its ecologically appropriate context . In my opinion, this makes it extremely important that our scientific studies provide reliable facts that support decisions related to the management and protection of wildlife habitats , flora & fauna populations , climate change , food production, forestry conservation ......so much so that an understanding of the relationship between human activity and the natural world will always play an important role ...and so far scientists still lack adequate funding ..which leads us into further trouble regarding proper monitoring systems required.....

If the researchers have gotten specimen collections directly out of fieldwork they might actually have DNA barcoding data because this will tell us things like phylogenetic relationships between organisms.

Thank you for this comprehensive answer. Do take note however that it would be more appropriate if you were to write your answer from scratch rather than just copy-pasting an excerpt from Wikipedia; we expect contributors here at ELL&U to show research effort and provide original material wherever applicable.\n\nAnswer: Insects are so numerous that scientists have subdivided them into smaller groups based upon morphological features (body shape), larval form (what kind of caterpillar), and behaviors (feeding, nest building).\n\nA group of related animals may belong to one family, but all families fall within one order. All orders then belong to one class, which can also contain similar animal classes such as reptiles or birds. Each phylum contains different kinds of organisms\u2014all animals belonging to the same phylum have similar body plans even though there may be very few characteristics shared between two different types of animals in the same phylum. Finally, every type of living thing belongs to either Plantae, Animalia, Fungi, Protozoa",

Invertebrate zoology, arachnology, myriapodology, diplopodology and other disciplines also often incorporate the study of arthropods. A recurring issue within entomological research has been around accessibility to knowledge by both professional scientists and amateur naturalists. This issue stems back into antiquity when Aristotle\u2019s Historia Animalium was one of only two sources for entomological knowledge. Since then there have been numerous advances in the field with publications such as Charles Darwin\u2019s The Formation of Vegetable Mould Through the Action of Worms published in 1881.\\n\\nIn order to gain greater insight into entomological practices we can look at the different types of approaches taken in relation to the questions above:\\n\\nThe first approach looks at how entomologists conduct their research based on where it takes place; either outdoors (field) or indoors (laboratory). Outdoor studies are generally more difficult because they take longer to collect specimens than if they were collected inside due to environmental factors affecting each organism differently.\\n\\nTherefore, most studies tend to be conducted inside laboratories since it allows scientists to control certain aspects such as temperature, humidity"

            "1. Insects have been studied by taxonomy since ancient times but the systematic methodology was first applied in Western Europe during Renaissance period with the works of Carolus Linnaeus, an Swedish natural scientist who laid the foundation for modern biological nomenclature.\n2. In the early days, collectors were interested primarily in large and colourful specimens. The collection of rare and unusual species has continued into recent years, although nowadays it often involves only small numbers of individuals collected from remote locations around the world. This trend has resulted in many new discoveries of previously unknown organisms which can be used to expand scientific knowledge about biodiversity. 3. Taxonomic classification of living things remains a challenge today due to the rapid rate at which new species are discovered (an estimated 500,000 new arthropod species alone) and the difficulty of distinguishing them from already existing ones using morphology-based techniques \\citep{Bellamy2014}. For example, two closely related species may appear identical under the naked eye yet differ slightly genetically or ecologically enough such that their separation is warranted according to current rules.\nThe problem becomes even more complicated because different groups have adopted varying standards when defining the characteristics of species. 4. Aside from taxon identification issues, another common obstacle faced by researchers includes lack of data regarding certain aspects of an insect\u2019s life history such as habitat requirements or food resources, which are crucial for conservation efforts aiming at protecting threatened populations. To overcome these problems, scientists have developed several approaches that rely heavily upon computer technology including DNA barcoding, automated image recognition software tools, and high throughput sequencing technologies like RADseq \\citep{Richter2019}, which allow simultaneous analysis of multiple samples without having to extract genomic DNA directly from individual insect bodies"

The wrong results? An error message? Something else entirely? Also, what language/library are you planning on using for NLP processing?\n\nAnswer: I would suggest breaking down the problem into three steps: tokenization (getting individual words), part-of-speech tagging (identifying which parts of speech each word belongs to) and dependency parsing (creating syntactic trees from tokens). After those three steps, you will have enough information to build up your desired model.\nHere are two packages I found [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) and [Spacy](http://spacy.io/).

We need more detail than just \"It isn't working\"\n\nAnswer: A few things I see wrong from reading this code over (and some tips):\n\nYou have `int n` declared above all of your other variables inside main(). This means it has global scope, which will override anything defined below it. So `n` becomes an integer variable for the whole program and you lose track of what value you had set when asking for input. Try removing it altogether and then declaring it right after userInput. Also make sure your `scanf()` call includes `%d`. The same goes for \\em{all} of your scanf() calls. As they stand now, `userAge`, `score()`, etc. will be treated like character strings rather than integers due to missing format specifiers (`%d`) on them as well. In addition, because you use single-quotes around those strings, each one will become a pointer to an array containing exactly three characters; a string literal without quotes would work fine. Lastly, I suggest using [printf](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/) as opposed to cout since you already use it once previously elsewhere.\n\nAfter getting past these problems there may still exist others but fixing these should get you closer."

Can anyone give a clue! I am struggling really hard now :( Thanks beforehand !!!\n\nAnswer: The solution that comes immediately to mind may not exactly be a good riddle - as others would suggest. Still, here goes. Take the message and put them into an array (in Python) : `$array = ['about', 'birthday','cakes']`, which gives us some idea of how many such riddles we get within just this given sample input. Given this example, at least 2 other questions pop up instantly. Here they go :)\n\nWhat if we take away any word of interest/choice (`$word`), e.g., 'birthdays' etc.; say, if `A = \"Birthdays\"` and `C = \"Cake\"`. We will use these two samples later . Then it can be rewritten as: `D = [3]` (either a count variable denoting the number of occurances of each, where $count is '4'). This gives us a much more clearer picture as far as length (no. of characters present in each of such words), their frequency and their locations wrt original text/message ($input). These facts form sort-of clues to figure out, what words we might require for each of the instances of `D[]` (assume each index represents different riddle type). So, first thing to learn from `E[0] = {'how_many':['about', 'my', '",
            "5 letters?\n\nAssistant: No more than five?\n\nUser: I am thinking about how many lines it have... Letters Lines. There can be other numbers too but they will never exceed two digits. And each digit is at most one-digit number\n(Example) One line has three letters so 3 x one = 2 + zero = 0 + 4= four (L+l)+1+(0*9). Two digits example 1 and Zero for 6x3=7+3 = ten *three times plus (3x 8)= eight *one time) = Nine\nTherefore the maximum value would by twelve. But this doesn't tell us much what if there is no letters on some spots maybe we got 0 as our result then maybe it isn\u2019t always going from left right top down like numbers in math. Or letters in english do you need to learn french or german first before counting or reading because \ud83e\udd14 you can get really confused easily.\n\nThis looks simple at First sight but if anyone thinks further he/she might get confused. It seems there must be clues in order to solve these things otherwise anyone without even basic mathematics knowledge would struggle\n\nSpoiler alert! The RIDDLE ANSWER:\nYou count it out, right??

So many disciplines involved which influences our decision-making process at different levels throughout each stage from initial site analysis till completion.  As a profession it also involves knowledge on materials & technology along with engineering science so one has an idea about building structure stability when making certain decisions. A lot of creativity comes into play especially for small sites. There could be numerous possibilities and constraints we need to overcome. One can take cues from historical examples, existing built forms within neighbourhoods and their patterns or create completely new scenarios and integrate them successfully in context through research. For instance if I was doing this project (I have attached pictures here too - the whole house garden design is a challenge since its surrounded by concrete structures around. So what would happen naturally cannot be allowed but needs intervention)  In addition, one has to look at maintenance concerns as well \u2013 plants, pests control and cleaning equipment accessibility; drainage, water flow etc\u2026 All these factors need consideration. And most importantly client interaction because afterall there must be consensus among us to reach an agreeable outcome and happy end user satisfaction!",
            "Landscape Architecture Principles\n1. Context \u2013 Design must fit with context and existing surroundings (not look awkward). The space has its own characteristics and unique elements such as weather patterns etc which needs to be considered during development stages so that there isn\u2019t too much impact on those natural occurrences and surrounding features/areas when constructing the site itself. For example a waterfront would require special planning consideration because it would affect nearby residents due to increased noise from traffic near this area if an event were hosted here for public consumption, whereas if an amphitheatre was constructed further back from residential areas it may not cause these problems and can be better utilised without negatively influencing neighbouring homes or properties.  2. Site Selection \u2013 The best place will be found through research of potential sites within given location constraints based off requirements gathered throughout previous phases such as project objectives. The main constraint usually is time frame, cost factor, sustainability considerations etc which are important aspects when considering the site selected to avoid any unnecessary complications arising down the track after construction. There are other constraints but the above are quite common and most applicable across different scenarios/contexts where one is developing their idea for landscaping a new outdoors environment/area whether private property, government building etc.    3. Concept Development \u2013 Once suitable sites have been determined through investigation of factors relating to client requests/needs then concepts can start being developed for implementation once all approval processes completed by authorities before moving onto next stage which includes documentation/design layout of chosen concept and details required at this phase depending upon specific task being carried out by company providing service to develop landscaped environments e.g. a small office complex would probably just need to submit floor plans with indication of trees planted in garden area whilst large shopping centre/residential buildings will involve detailed architectural drawings and calculations etc needed for builders and developers involved"

            "Landscape Architecture can be defined as \u201cthe analysis, planning, design, management, preservation, rehabilitation and restoration of the land\u201d. The practice has two main aspects which includes landscape planning (Landscape Architectural Design) and site engineering. Site Engineering is more about understanding what it takes to build a structure on top of an existing one and ensuring there is no compromise done to its original integrity whereas; Landscape Planning deals with analyzing, developing, improving upon, and implementing strategies for urban areas. These involve everything from city parks and streetscapes to suburban developments and industrial estates. A few other major disciplines under this profession includes landscape ecology, landscape construction & plant knowledge etc. There are certain fundamental principles and practices used by Landscape architectures like \u2018Site Analysis\u2019 \u2013 It involves evaluating different features present at the given area before proceeding further with developmental plans. For instance; sun exposure, drainage, slope of terrain, soil quality, views etc. Another important aspect would be to identify if the location will suit our requirements and needs based on factors such as proximity to transportation facilities, social services, natural resources and amenities available within reach. Next step after site analysis would be creating conceptual sketches to communicate ideas. Concept drawings play an integral role when explaining concepts related to designs, spatial organization and functionality to clients and colleagues alike. SketchUp Pro software comes handy during these situations as it helps create detailed images along with precise measurements to aid in visualizing space efficiently. Also, there exists various methods involved in Landscape architecture which makes up a big part of the profession namely: Sustainable sites \u2013 This methodology focuses mainly on building structures which take into account their environmental impact throughout all phases of the life cycle i.e. production, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, reuse, dispos"

Landscape architect uses the natural resources available at site like soil, water bodies etc to create beautiful landscapes by making proper drainage system, planting suitable plants according to climate conditions etc.,\n2. They also plan roads and pathways so that these become part of the whole landscape and enhance its beauty\n3. In urban development planning they try to maintain greenery wherever it can be done.\n4. The concept called 'Green Building' which was first developed by US Green building council has now been accepted worldwide for construction of eco-friendly buildings with minimum impact on environment\n5. It includes concepts such as rainwater harvesting ,solar power generation using solar panels, waste management systems (compost pit), recycling of plastic, glass etc.,\n6. There is a special branch called \"Urban Ecology\" wherein we study about different types of habitats found within cities, the flora & fauna there and their interdependence on one another.\n7. For instance, if trees are removed from a place due to lack of maintenance then insects living on them may die too and this will affect the birds living near those places because they would lose food source i.e. insect population\n8. This chain reaction could cause an imbalanced ecosystem and hence we need experts who understand the dynamics of such ecologically sensitive areas and take care of the same during development projects\n9.

            "The first principle of Landscape Architecture is sustainability. This means using resources efficiently so we will have enough for future generations. It also includes creating environments that allow natural processes such as water flow to occur without damaging structures like houses or roads. Sustainable landscapes are healthier than non-sustainable ones because it allows ecosystems to continue functioning on their own. Some examples of this are rainwater collection systems, permeable paving materials (that let water pass through), vegetative buffers along streams etc. These all reduce storm runoff into rivers and oceans which can cause floods and erosion if done improperly, making our environment more resilient against these types of events.\nAnother major aspect of Landscape Architecture is site analysis; understanding where a building sits within its contextual surroundings. For example, what type of soil exists underneath the ground, how much rainfall does it get each year, how close is it located next to other buildings or parks. By analyzing a location\u2019s environmental characteristics, architects/designers are able to determine how best to work with them when planning a project.\n\n\\end{code}\n\nAnswer: In order to get rid off those empty lines between the questions you need to add `break` statements at the end of every block.

This concept has been widely accepted by many countries around the world since it was introduced at the World Commission on Environment and Development conference held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. It is also known as \"sustainable growth\" which refers to economic growth that meets human needs for present generation but doesn\u2019t damage natural environment so that future generations can continue to benefit from them. In other words, this term describes an economy where resources are consumed at rates that allow those resources to be renewed naturally.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\strong{\\em{Sustainable Design}} - A process that seeks to create buildings and communities with minimal environmental impact through careful planning and consideration of all aspects of building construction and operation.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe second principle I want to discuss is resilience.

They are able to bounce back after disaster strikes. For example, when Hurricane Sandy hit New York City in October 2012, the city had already prepared itself for extreme weather events due to climate change. As a result, there were no deaths reported during the hurricane. However, in the neighboring state of New Jersey, more than 35 people died because of lack of preparation.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\strong{\\em{Responsive Architecture}} - An approach to architectural practice that emphasizes responsiveness between built form and its contextual conditions"

For example, \\textit{\u201cThe answer would be zero\u201d}, ``I am lost\u201d,``This problem seems impossible to solve\", etc... Some people answered correctly, however, they had trouble articulating their reasoning. A common error was describing actions rather than reasons e.g., \u201cLooking through all rooms,\u201d ``Going to all rooms.\" Other mistakes were grammatical errors such as misplaced articles or tense agreement. Finally, some participants attempted to use logical tricks without understanding them well enough, such as \\textit{\"There could be more than three lights, but let us assume that we need three of them\"} . The latter approach also reveals how these participants lack an adequate understanding of the conceptual underpinnings behind their own thinking processes. We conclude that although humans might have superior performance when solving certain kinds of problems compared to current machine learning algorithms, most of those skills are difficult to replicate with language models because of challenges associated with generating text with linguistic fluency and proper grammar~\\cite{kelleher2017effective}.

In addition, our user asked several questions to get more clarity from AI Assistant about how he solved his problem; the agent did not respond at all to these follow-ups and continued repeating the same incorrect solution over and over. It is worth mentioning here that we tested many similar cases wherein users were given wrong feedbacks by the agent. This shows that the model is still lacking robustness and needs to work further on identifying such scenarios. Our future work includes exploring different methods to improve the robust performance of this model so it could provide better feedback to users when they face challenges during conversations.\n\nWe also observed some errors in the dialogue history logs generated by the system due to the presence of multiple utterances by the user in a single line. For example, ``\\emph{'how would you do it?' 'i would go to the first door...'}'' is recorded by the system as just two lines - ``\\emph{How would you do i?} ''and ``, \\emph{wouldyougo tofirstdoortocheckthebulb}''.

For finding if a particular node exists inside the Binary Search Tree using inorder Traversal , we have the following recurrence relation -`T(1)=0 T(2) = c+T(l), where 'c' is constant which represents time taken for accessing a leaf`. The worst case would happen at a leaf, hence c=2, this means, time complexity will always remain 2 for reaching leaves no matter whatever is our size of BST.`So Time Complexity would be:T(N)=C(n+2)`. Since, we cannot get `fraction of a second`, we need an integer representation, so here it can also represent O(`2`). As you increase the values from `n + 2`, you start seeing bigger numbers such as 4,5... This tells us about the performance of an Algorithm with reference to `data-size and the type of machine` we are executing the code upon, so here if the size grows then time will grow accordingly and vice versa.. For instance : We could see below image that `Runtime` remains same for small sizes but increases gradually with growing input. That means if our `Inputs/variables`are large in count or huge in terms of magnitude or size ,we tend to see slower runtimes as compared to smaller sized algorithms because it takes more resources and longer execution times .The other factor involved in deciding these types of behavior of an algoithm with varying size is Machine Types"

This lead to global success for other boy groups like Super Junior, SHINee and Big Bang who all achieved great international fame.

In particular, some genres play an important role during Lunar New Year celebrations. A type of musical ensemble called nongak which includes drums, gongs, flutes and fiddles is played when visiting family members to wish them luck.

It has been suggested that there were also some secret projects such as NEXUS and PARK-LUCK funded through military-industrial complex, but this has never really been confirmed officially (think Area 51 for comparison).

            "Kpop refers to cultural content produced by people around the country of South Korea. This includes everything from television shows and movies starring native actors and actresses and even cartoons. However it can also refer to songs sung in Korean language by either male or female artists who perform for audiences around the world. The style of music performed is referred to as pop music due its combination between westernized rock and electronic influences combined with traditional Korean elements such as instrumentation. These groups are often formed and debuted in large concerts known as \"Concerts\" where they first attract the attention of media platforms, managements companies looking to hire talent. Many famous KPop bands got started at these Concerts such as Big Bang or EXO \\textbf{}. Once under contract KPops often travel across Asia promoting their new album releases through sold out performances, many times touring throughout Japan then back home to Seoul or some other south Korean city for another round up of excitement before moving onto China/Taiwan etc.\n\\end{blockquote}"

            "The war brought together various styles and sounds from all over the world which created some really cool hybrids such as jazz funk etc.. Also people wanted more variety than they had previously been allowed by governmental controls. It also meant musicians were now free to play their own music rather than playing whatever was told them by officials... Music played an important role in creating solidarity during difficult times after WWII with American forces occupying South Korea (the south). Musicians were often asked to write songs about love for example and patriotism because this gave Koreans hope in those tough years where life was extremely hard following devastation of countrywide scale and economic ruin.... During periods when the political situation in South Korea has been uncertain/chaotic like in 1960s & '70s pop/rock/disco bands were used by dictatorships as propaganda machines and entertainment but since democratisation and increased wealth, musical expression became freer although it remains largely confined to capital city Seoul where many big-name Kpop groups hail from ... As a result I would say the majority of music coming out today isn't representative of true local sound preferences, nor reflective of actual lives of everyday ordinary working class folk - but that will hopefully change eventually as there seems to be quite strong anti-establishment feeling growing amongst younger generation.",
            "Popular music has become very common today in Korea since its creation in 1970 by Seo Taiji (a band) and has spread widely across many parts of Korea because of how fast-paced people like to hear songs and also enjoy them for entertainment purposes only; therefore it can be seen nowadays as more accessible compared with traditional genres such as pansori or kkwaenggwari due to how long these two genres have been around before this type of musical genre became prevalent within Korean Culture.\\r\\nThe most recent types of Korean Pop Music can easily relate to American/British music such as rock & roll but at the same time maintains its original characteristics of their own cultural music so there is an amalgamation of both western influences yet preserving unique features about the art itself. For example some songs would be heavily influenced by other genres however the melody of each song may be kept relatively simple yet distinctive depending upon the style and genre they belong too; therefore allowing Koreans themselves to differentiate between various subgenre's that are related but different. Some songs do use foreign lyrics when composing them, but there still is no lack of using solely English language as well; therefore providing options to suit listeners needs without making either feel excluded if a particular preference is used during a concert which may offend one person and satisfy another who doesn't prefer a specific method. There was controversy about the quality of music that artists create as the focus has changed from the artist having great singing ability but now focused much more towards how visibly attractive they appear, where previously artists had a wider variety of body shapes, height etc; but currently in modern day music all idols tend to look alike regardless of age difference \\u2013 so even younger idol groups consist mainly of female singers undergoing cosmetic surgery or extreme"

            "The influence of K-pop music is increasing day by day with the growing globalization and the emergence of new social media platforms like YouTube which enables anyone around the world to listen to the latest songs and trends from other countries at ease without having to pay anything extra for it. The music industry is no longer confined within one geographical location but is now more widely available through digital technology, satellite broadcasting etc., and thus spreads globally much faster than before. With this change comes the opportunity for many different artists/musicians all over the globe to express their thoughts freely without any restriction regarding creativity, expression and imagination unlike before where there was always someone trying to suppress such talent. It is because of these changes in music industries across various parts of the world including Asia that we see a rapid growth in music streaming services (like Spotify) along with an increase in revenue generation via sales of tickets to concerts performed by musicians from around the world. Also, people today can access multiple sources of entertainment through just one device thanks to apps like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video which allow users to watch movies and TV shows based on genres they prefer, whenever they want to do so. All this helps promote tourism among countries, which in turn contributes to the economic development of nations and creates employment opportunities too. However, even though technological advancements have helped boost the growth rate of the music sector significantly, it still remains vulnerable due to piracy issues since some of us would rather download songs illegally using torrent sites if those particular tracks aren\u2019t made readily accessible online for purchase.

            "1945~1960s, after World War II (WW2), Western Music came into Korea through American soldiers stationed there, who brought along with them Jazz music. This led Koreans to start listening to jazz music, which then influenced their own music style, creating a fusion between the two genres. The first Korean rock group was called Yoon Doo-Hwan Band, formed by Yoon Doo-Hwan himself back when he was only 17 years old. They started out singing covers of English rock groups like Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple but quickly gained fame for performing original songs. In the late '80s/early '90s, pop music took over, especially since it had more commercial success than other genres at that period. Groups such as Seo Taiji & Boys were extremely successful and paved way for many others to follow in this genre. However, Kpop today still draws influence from its predecessors. Many people have been inspired by previous generations and use these influences in their work. For example, BTS drew inspiration from SeoTaiJi&Boys\u2019 song \"Nan Arayo\" (\"I Know\") to write \u201cBlood Sweat & Tears\u201d, which they performed during the MMA Awards last year.\\par I hope that this helps!

We used \\textit{\\textbf{en}} as language model and performed \\texttt{sentiment-analysis} API over our corpus.

The scores were scaled between -1 and +1, where -1 means negative, 0 neutral, and 1 positive. These scores can also represent other emotions like anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Table~\\ref{tab:emotional_categories} shows different categories and their associated values along with some examples of words falling under those categories. Based on these categorized scores we found out which topics users tend to discuss more about, and how often they talk about them.\nWe use these sentiment scores for evaluating user responses during interaction with the system. Our evaluation criteria consists of measuring whether there is similarity in sentiment of questions asked and response provided. In this work, we assume the ideal situation when a user asks a question having same polarity (positive vs.\\@ negative) and similar",

In this case, the chatbot responded positively, even though it could have given negative feedback if there was some rule violation from Alice's side. It may seem obvious now how the dialogues can be constructed, however, it would be interesting to study the properties of the resulting interactions in more detail, e.g., when will people trust their partner in these conversations, etc. For example, the model proposed by \\citet{Koller_NIPS-14} considers learning human behavior from observations through the reward mechanism, which requires humans to interact with bots for many times before the training process finishes. Therefore, we believe that understanding the quality of conversational partnership among agents, including their behaviors and performance metrics, might facilitate designing more effective methods of socializing artificial intelligence systems. Moreover, it will provide better insight into the fundamental limitations of machine learning models and thus enable us to improve current algorithms and create new ones. This research also opens up several practical applications such as developing assistive robots who work alongside other autonomous devices; intelligent software for healthcare, education, finance, entertainment and business industries; etc. Our approach provides valuable tools for testing these"

            "The sun has already started to shrink from the outside due to less fusion reactions taking place because it can no longer generate enough pressure at its core, but this takes thousands of years before we notice anything happening. We\u2019ll start seeing some dramatic effects once the outer layers cool down so much they begin collapsing on themselves. In around five billion years time, after spending another three billion years turning into a red giant, the star will collapse under gravity until only about half its original diameter remains \u2014 by which point most planets have been long since swallowed up anyway. Once it gets small enough for nuclear processes inside to stop working completely, there won\u2019t be enough energy left to hold off the force of gravitational contraction forever; eventually the whole thing will crunch itself together and become one extremely massive white dwarf. But even then, when all of those atoms get too close, their mutual electromagnetic repulsion starts pushing them apart again. So over the next few hundred million years, more and more mass continues leaking away from the dead remnant star. Eventually the remaining gas condenses into what astronomers call \u201cplanetary nebulae,\u201d glowing clouds of ionized plasma and dust that expand outward into interstellar space. This entire process usually lasts between ten thousand and two hundred thousand years depending on how big the dying star was initially\u2014and even if it doesn\u2019t leave behind any actual planetary system afterwards, each cloud of material could still end up forming new stars, galaxies, solar systems... maybe even life-supportive planets somewhere else.",
            "1. The sun\u2019s core contains hydrogen gas under very high pressure because it has been heated by nuclear fusion processes for billions of years. This process continues today within the cores of all stars like our own, but when these stars have used up their supply of fuel, they begin to shrink away from us, dimming and cooling over time until finally they become white dwarfs. So what happens now? It turns out that even though there isn\u2019t much left of them after this stage, there still might be some life remaining inside them! Stars start off with massive supplies of energy that comes directly from gravitational potential energy stored at the center. Then during most of its lifetime, a star fuses together lighter elements into heavier ones through a process called nucleosynthesis \u2013 which releases more energy than can possibly come from gravity alone. This excess power gets trapped in the form of photons - particles of light -- so eventually there ends up being just enough matter around the core for it to maintain balance between gravitational collapse and nuclear burning. When this balance breaks down, everything collapses onto itself due to gravity and creates extreme temperatures, which create fusion reactions again leading back to equilibrium. Once this cycle stops happening, the core cools rapidly forming a white dwarf that becomes darker and cooler as time goes on; and also radiates less and less heat and light. Now let me show you how the helium accumulates inside it... As we mentioned earlier, when two atoms of Helium merge together they release energy that keeps the whole system stable. But this doesn\u2019t happen easily because it requires a lot of temperature to do so. And remember that the surface layer starts out incredibly hot as a result of all those collisions, but gradually it begins to lose thermal radiation. In other words, the outer layers cool down as the inner part stays extremely hot, thus creating huge pressures towards the core"

            "\\textbf{Astronomy-assistant:} Thanks for using Ask Astronomers! Let me try to give the best available explanation. Our sun will become a supernova when it runs out of fuel but before that happens there would be some intermediate stages and we can predict this based on many other observed stars going through these same processes. As gas collapses into our star core hydrogen continues fusing into helium. Eventually all of the hydrogen left within the core of solar system\u2019s nearest start has been consumed; this point corresponds to about 10% the mass remaining at this time and then Helium burning begins forming Carbon which further becomes Oxygen over timescales much larger than our current life cycle (like millions of years). Hydrogen fusion will continue up until its used at the heart of our star leaving only small amounts throughout the outer regions of stellar atmosphere where temperatures are low enough for atoms to slow down sufficiently so they may bond with each other \u2013 forming new molecules. This leaves Helium fusing into elements such as Carbon Nitrogen etc\u2026 Once the sun is composed entirely of metals no more energy production occurs since photons cannot bind these elements together. The center of what once was the sun cools quickly reaching 5 billion degrees Kelvin by this time most objects outside of Earth have long evaporated away leaving just the core and the planetary bodies near us. As temperature decreases the nuclear reaction rate drops drastically rendering the helium fusion process obsolete. It doesn\u2019t take very long afterward for our closest neighboring bodies including Mars to meet their end at the hands of gravitational collapse under increased radiation exposure from our exploding sun which causes the heat source required for atmospheric pressure. Now back on Earth you might think that we humans were luckily protected during all of those chaotic events but really what had transpired was only the beginning stages of",
            "This will depend on what phase it goes through first. In short, after running out of hydrogen fuel for fusion reactions at its core temperature cools off enough for helium elements to form there. If those were made from nuclear fusions they would become heavier, with higher mass numbers than helium 4 nucleus itself contains because some particles collide and fuse together into new nuclei, creating these byproducts called ash matter. These heavy elements have larger energy levels so they can still be used as sources, although they cannot be absorbed easily due to their lowered potential energies at which photons can combine within them. Therefore, gravity increases more quickly when atoms start getting this lightweighted, making the sun smaller in size again like before. The gravitational pull strength then becomes too weak to maintain its orbiting objects and eventually expands without limit beyond our galaxy, ending life forms existing. \n\nComment: What did I just ask?

It\u2019s called \u201cthermonuclear\u201d fusion because the reaction requires more energy than normal nuclear decay would give off. So, the fuel inside the star needs some extra heat.

The most common forms of defense come from attacks directed at humans where physical injuries might occur if the body armor used did not provide adequate protection from knives, swords or firearms; emotions such as anxiety about dying prematurely before retirement age due to accidental death. In extreme cases the effects may be traumatic with psychiatric issues following injury leading to suicide or self-destructive behaviors resulting in severe addictions and disrupting normal living.  For animals they suffer physical injuries directly through wounds sustained during hunting activity by human hunters, animal predators such as large carnivores and raptors like hawks or eagles or through weather related causes. Animals will react immediately with evasive behavior upon perceiving threat and responding according to its innate abilities depending upon the situation and level of danger posed by whatever species causing alarm signals to the senses whether sight, smell or",

This is irrational but still serves some kind of evolutionary purpose for humans since it would have helped our ancestors who were afraid of falling down from trees (which is how most animals die). However I am more interested on whether fear itself has evolved through natural selection over time. 3) We may also fear other types of things such as ghosts, monsters under beds, aliens etc., but these are all imaginary and therefore irrational. These could just simply stem from childhood trauma, parental influence/conditioning or maybe due to lack of exposure to new experiences. 4) The brain creates scenarios with different probabilities when faced with situations of high uncertainty e.g if you go outside at night alone vs with company. Whenever the probability becomes less than 50%, anxiety kicks in. So yes, we do fear many irrational things!\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nComment: What is this site?

            "1) Fear is an emotion which can be triggered by many different stimuli. For example, if someone has been bitten by a dog before they may have developed a phobia for dogs. This means that when they see a dog their body will react with feelings of anxiety even though it poses no threat to them at all. The same applies to other animals such as spiders etc. 2) We also tend to develop fears from our parents/guardians. They teach us what to fear through stories about monsters under beds, ghosts in closets, and so on. These fears are often passed down generation after generation because people believe these myths without ever testing whether they\u2019re true or not. 3) Another way we learn to fear certain things is through media. Movies, TV shows, books, video games, etc., use scary imagery to create tension within viewers. This makes them more likely to watch again next time around. 4) Lastly, some people just seem to naturally be afraid of everything! I think this comes down to how much control they feel over their lives. People who lack confidence in themselves are less able to cope with uncertainty than those who do. So, they try to avoid anything that might trigger negative emotions like fear.\n\\end{code}"

These farmers usually tried hard to keep these wineries running successfully throughout years. Whenever they made big business deals there was no room left even for them. But still some did manage to run business personally with less manpower support like my friend\u2019s family. My father died in 1965 when I was only one month old and ever since she was working very hard single-handedly on her ranch growing rice by herself; however, those days all local growers kept together supporting each other because agriculture was really lucrative during 70's.

However, this doesn\u2019t mean that all CO will reach the ground because some of it may be carried away by wind currents. 2) The amount of CO produced depends on how much fuel is burnt. For example, if there was more coal burning then there would be more CO released into the air. 3) When CO mixes with other gases such as Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), they form smog which blocks out sunlight from reaching plants below. Plants need light for photosynthesis so without enough light, plant growth slows down. 4) Smoke particles also absorb heat energy from the Sun. As these smoke particles rise up through the troposphere, they cool off and fall back down again. This process causes convectional cells within the atmosphere. These convective cells cause turbulence in the upper levels of the stratosphere. Turbulence creates waves in the atmosphere which disrupt the jet stream. Jet streams carry warm air northward during winter months and cold air southward during summer months. Disruption of the jet stream leads to extreme weather conditions like droughts, floods, hurricanes etc. 5) In addition to this, CO also absorbs infrared radiation emitted by the earth. Infrared radiation helps keep our planet at an average temperature of about 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Without this radiation, temperatures could drop significantly causing ice ages. 6) Finally, CO reacts chemically with water vapour present in clouds forming acid rain. Acid rain damages buildings, crops, trees and lakes. It also kills fish and wildlife living near bodies of water.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nComment: I"

There are many opportunities for augmented reality because unlike virtual reality where users need to remove themselves from their surroundings through wearing special glasses / googles etc., the idea behind augmented reality is simply making use of the world already surrounding us by adding extra information on top of what we would normally see using our eyes alone. For example, imagine looking at your smartphone screen - if you could point your camera toward say a shop window and see the products inside that particular store appear in front of you without actually having to go inside, then that would definitely be considered \"augmentation\" rather than just another way to access additional data. The real benefits here come down to efficiency, safety, cost savings etc.. It also allows for a better user experience too since it doesn't require the wearer to look away completely from everything else going on around them - when driving for instance someone may prefer to keep one eye open on road conditions whilst reading upcoming directions on google maps displayed directly onto their car windshield via AR...\n\nAssistant: Do you play games often on mobile devices, console or PC/Mac?\n\n\\textbf{Question:} User: Whenever I am"

Additionally they did not contain multi-turn questions and answers but rather single turn statements.

            "3D Printing is an innovation that helped to develop more comfortable fit for these types of products which makes it easier on consumers. \\textbf{It was created by Avi Reichental} (inventor). Also \\textbf{\\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaunt_(company)}{JAUNT}} developed the camera equipment that helps record all angles when creating the 360-degree video so there can be different experiences within each environment depending what direction someone turns their heads.\\newline Another thing is the ability to move around using sensors, making movement realistic because of this innovation we were able to get the best immersion from VR without getting motion sickness! It is important that I add here though, some people do experience symptoms similar to seasickness, nausea and disorientation, however many of them adapt over time through exposure and become desensitized. The good news is there is still plenty research happening now that may result into prevention measures and medicines soon! There are even games specifically made for people with simulator sickness who have problems with standard gaming VR, one such example is the game 'Spatium' by Ethervision Games, check out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHrWfhxTGmQ\\footnote{\\href{http://ethervisiongames.com}{EthervisionGames}}\\footnote{\\href{http://ethervisiongames.com/spatium_for_sale.html}{SPATIUM}}. \\cite{jones2018simulator}.\\cite{crystal2019effective}\\cite{nour2017health} \\cite{ponsonby2004differential}.\\newline Other innovators are Google with Cardboard (Very low cost entry",
            "3D displays for computers and phones were available from Nintendo but did not take off at first due to limited graphics power and expensive screens (in terms of pixels). Then Samsung developed its Galaxy smartphones with 1080p displays and these had a great resolution compared to most monitors and laptops of this time. However they could be damaged easily so companies began to look into foldable OLED technology which allowed for smaller, thinner, brighter displays with no visible crease.\nIn parallel there was research going on into holographic projections which allow you to have full parallax depth by displaying separate images onto multiple layers, such that an object will appear solid even when seen at different angles because light reflected towards the eye is redirected using lenses in all directions simultaneously rather than having each point display a single color only in one direction.\nFinally Oculus and Valve developed affordable PC VR hardware capable of delivering smooth framerates. HTC later followed suit after Google stopped development of Cardboard V2, however Google now supports WebVR for both Android & Chrome OS, making it possible to experience some aspects of VR through the web without owning a high end computer/smartphone combination device. The quality still leaves much room for improvement though! This allows us to do VR games & other activities within a browser window which makes things easier and less expensive overall since users won't need additional accessories beyond what already exists inside their home - including TVs & internet connectivity! In the future, AR may also replace or augment current screen interfaces depending on how developers use the technology and how people prefer interacting with digital systems! It is too early to say right now, especially considering how few apps currently exist. We might find ourselves asking if we actually wanted AR at all, like the case of mobile virtual reality, once it has become mainstream! So many people"

            "3D games were the most prominent factor which helped the increase in demand for VR Headset sales over the years because they offered immersive gameplay experience like never before and hence gamers wanted to enjoy their favorite video games on more than one platform and Virtual Reality was the next logical step towards it after gaming consoles, smartphones and PCs but even then the hardware needed to run those high-end graphic intensive games was too expensive for everyone to afford so Google introduced Cardboard (Google\u2019s low cost virtual reality headset) back in September 2014 with the launch of its new operating system Android Lollipop which had a lot of support from many tech giants including Samsung who came up with GearVR by combining Oculus Rift with Galaxy Note 5 phone within a year followed by HTC who partnered with Valve to introduce VIVE (HTC\u2019s premium version of VR device). Now there have been some major changes since the last time I answered this question i.e., nowadays the VR market has started shifting toward mobile VR devices such as Daydream View by Google and GearVR by Samsung etc.\n\\fi\n\nTo assess our approach quantitatively, we conducted two sets of experiments on three different datasets, where each dataset consists of human responses to a single QA session along with their corresponding user features and task difficulty level. We compared these datasets against each other based on four metrics namely accuracy, precision, recall, F$@n$ and ROUGE scores. These results showed that our model achieved better performance across all cases except one case out of nine (where only two datasets exist), thereby proving that our methodology works well when tested against real world data. To summarize, we performed extensive tests using several different settings to demonstrate that our model performs reasonably well on different scenarios, although we",
            "3D virtual reality was used for the first time in the 1960s but it did not gain much traction due to technological limitations such as poor display resolution, lack of suitable software and limited tracking systems which resulted in discomfort from nausea during use. The current trend of increased adoption can be attributed to several factors including improved graphics rendering technology through advanced hardware such as high-resolution screens, higher refresh rates and reduced screen door effect (where images look pixelated). Other reasons could also include improvements on sensors that allow accurate head movements to track objects and interaction with real world environments using augmented reality tools. Improved comfort by designing lightweight and more ergonomic devices has further boosted this industry growth. Finally, cost reductions have enabled many companies to invest heavily into creating better experiences that drive their revenue."

These screens provide an immersive experience where it feels like objects exist inside of virtual space rather than outside of it. This makes the experience more realistic and less disorienting for people who use VR headsets. 2. Improved motion tracking technology allows users to interact with the virtual world using natural hand gestures, without requiring additional equipment such as gloves/gadgets. For example, some systems track movement via infrared light sensors embedded into the walls of a room; others utilize camera-based motion capture techniques, allowing users freedom of motion within the confines of a small space. 3. The advent of mobile phones and tablets capable of supporting VR applications means that consumers no longer have to invest in costly hardware to enjoy the VR experience, but they also need a pair of VR goggles to view images on the devices. As these smartphones become cheaper due to technological advancements and mass production, the barrier towards entry has decreased considerably, leading to increased consumer interest. 4. Companies such as Samsung, HTC and Facebook continue to release new versions of their products at competitive prices. This drives demand among early adopters because newer models offer better resolution and improved comfort over previous generations. 5. New software features and apps allow developers to create more engaging experiences.

Note it can be optimized but this gets the idea across easily. Also note if we assume only one playlist has all these songs (not an issue with the given problem), then each time `match_one` finds the first occurrence it can be skipped. However there might be cases where the song was added after another version had already been found which could complicate things further. So my recommendation would just to use two versions here: one using a single match, the other without checking previous occurrences so long as the second item doesn't match the same artist name etc.:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Iterate through items. If we have matched our search terms return result and skip next item since nothing new will add anything meaningful from what has been gathered. This prevents needless extra calls. Otherwise check the item for the target. For every occurence update our dictionary mapping to results and move onto next iteration unless the key value matches an existing value, i.e., if a user entered 'Aerosmith', the output list should look like this when matching by song: `[{\"name\": \"Walk This Way\", ...}, {\"name\": \"Sweet Emotion\"}]`. If it doesn't then continue looking. Finally collect everything at once and return dict with artists grouped by unique name strings, e.g. {'Red Hot': ['By The Way']}. Then filter those names to remove duplicates leaving only top N per category: `{\"Foo Bar Band\": [{\"artists\": [\"Blah\"], ...}}]` etc. We want the highest ranked value of whatever the search term may yield otherwise filtering would fail because they were never filtered down.

The most important development I believe has been the rise of Virtual Reality technologies which were first introduced at GDC 2014 by Oculus Rift team members John Carmack and Brendan Iribe on their VR headset called 'Oculus Rift'. At last year's E3 conference it was announced that Sony would release its own version known as Project Morpheus \\cite{oculus1} while Microsoft launched HoloLens technology\\footnote{\\url{http://www.microsoft.com/hololens/}}. In recent months HTC Vive also made itself available through Steam Early Access and now Valve is looking into integrating virtual reality support within SteamVR platform. This means we can expect full VR integration across PC gaming platforms including Steam. Also, VR devices have already started becoming affordable so this new form of media consumption will reach consumers worldwide soon enough.

            "2013 was an exciting year for game developers who aimed at delivering educational purposes with new technologies such as augmented reality or virtual reality (either computer-generated worlds or objects), which have been growing steadily since then \\cite{augmentereality,augmentedrealityvideogames}. According to the data compiled by Steam, a digital distribution platform in video game industry launched on September 11th, 2003, and now the largest retailer of PC & Mac games worldwide\\footnote{\\url {https://store.steampowered.com/index.php}}, gaming hardware revenue grew significantly between January 2014 ($857 million) until April 2019 when it reached $964 billion; this growth shows the increasing demands of gamers to play more realistic experiences, either through better screen technology or other tools such as VR headsets \\cite{gamerstats}. Virtual Reality Headset (VRH) sales increased from $1.2 billion in 2014 according to Gartner Group \\cite{gartner} up to approximately \\$8.21 billions in 2017 sold by Sony\\footnote{\\url{www.cnet.com}} alone along with HTC Vive\\footnote{\\url{www.htcvr.com}}. The most common use case for these devices could be training future drivers using simulators like \"Forza Street\" (Microsoft Windows PC, Xbox One), and \"Assetto Corsa Competizione\u201d (PC). Opportunities can also come out in different education fields where educator may teach through their online classes how some topics look alike - for example, in medical school students learn about the human body by interacting virtually without having the need to dissect bodies beforehand \u2013 a great advantage in",
            "In the recent years \\textbf{Susan}, you may have read in a number articles about how \\texttt{\\textbf{Virtual Realities} }are going to take over this world with a \\textit{\"big bang\"} and change our lives forever\\footnote{This can be seen e.g., when an increasing amount of people is becoming aware of virtual reality (VR) products such as Vive, Oculus etc.} . Many authors agree on claiming ``\\textbf{virtual realities are set to revolutionize entertainment media}'' (\\cite{2016_Ito}). I think what they mean here is that ``entertainment media'' could provide the user with more \\emph{interactivity}. One example for that would be \\textit{Museums at Home} mentioned by \\citet{cunningham}. This article discusses ways in which museum collections might one day become available online without compromising the experience due to lack of interactivity which users currently face during their visits to physical museum exhibitions.\\looseness=-1 To sum it up we can state \"people would like to see the same artefacts online\". On top that author adds that \u201eThe problem with most computer reconstructions [of art] is that so far they only display reproduction images; there has been no attempt to recreate the experience of viewing them\u201d(Cunningham 2). Thereby Virtual Reality makes great use out of it in the form of providing a completely immersed version of visiting a museum where the viewer experiences the piece from all angles and feels almost as if he/she were present physically within its surroundings in the gallery space.\nIn contrast other sources do not share such optimistic views for the future implementation of VR into daily life since VR headsets still come quite expensive compared to conventional televisions with HD resolution.

            "2017 saw a surge of research into Serious Games, which refers to the use of gaming for education or training purposes rather than just pure entertainment. It can be applied to healthcare too with gamification \\citep{jacobsen_effectiveness} . For instance, video games such as \\emph{\"Affectiva\"} by Plarium and \"Superbetter\" were created using these technologies (gamified apps). However, the majority of game developers prefer casual mobile applications since they offer greater profits\\citep{cristiano}. As mentioned before, virtual reality is gaining traction thanks to new technological advancements, like HTC Vive ($949 USD), Oculus Rift ($\\textgreater{}350 USD) etc. Moreover, AR-based apps are on demand, so Apple Inc has developed their own technology called \"ARKit\", and it is used mainly in marketing and educational campaigns, wherein companies try to increase user engagement. On top of this, Microsoft Corporation announced their first AR device, Hololens 2($3500 USD). AI also plays an important role nowadays in designing new products based on data mining from online surveys or focus groups \\cite{peter2}. For example, \\emph{Unity}, a game development software allows developers to integrate third party SDK components in order to implement real time features in the games such as face detection/tracking , gesture recognition or even object identification using artificial intelligence\\footnote{\\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiTkMfzOaNY}}. Also, the industry giants are developing platforms such as XR Academy or Udemy which provides online courses to students around the world about creating and developing virtual and augmented experiences, using the latest available tech\\cite{alex}.",
            "2016 saw some really cool VR releases (like The Unspoken for Oculus Touch), and more interesting applications in medicine \\& therapy such as BrainHQ, an online cognitive training system used by millions around the world, including patients suffering from ADHD and Parkinson\u2019s disease\\cite{BBCBrainHq}. We also got Pokemon Go this year, which is still quite popular now! A new kind of mobile app game was introduced - so called \u2018soft-gaming\u2019, which doesn't involve hardcore gaming at all. Soft gaming refers to simple yet entertaining mini-game apps designed primarily to distract people from stress rather than engage them actively.\\cite{NatSoftGam} For instance, Facebook released \u201cSlingshot\u201d app for iPhone & Android smartphones allowing users send photo/video attachments along with text messages via messaging interface similar to Snapchat\\cite{TechRadar}. As well there were a few interesting social media related experiments conducted in Russia - they tested the ability of social media influence on behavior change. People were given small amounts of money and told it could be increased if they changed their attitude toward vaccination\\cite{Kalashnikov2015VaxxedRussia}, which worked very successfully! Finally we witnessed many important technological innovations such as cloud gaming and cloud streaming, both enabling users access powerful video processing hardware remotely over Internet. It is already changing the landscape for developers working with heavy visual content\\cite{CrossleyCloud}. And of course I would like to mention virtual reality (VR) devices - Oculus Rift finally started shipping to customers in March, Google announced its own VR device called Daydream View in October\\cite{OculusRiftGoogle}, Sony revealed PlayStation VR release date ($39"

            "2018 saw the rise of augmented reality (AR) applications, with many AR games entering into development on both mobile platforms like Android and iOS \\citep{AugmentedReality} as well as VR systems such as Oculus Rift and HTC VIVE. A large number of these new apps have been based around education and healthcare; however, some of them are just for fun. This includes the likes of Pok\u00e9mon GO which uses an overlay on top of real world objects and places \\citep{PokemonGO}, along with Google Translate, where users can use their camera phones to translate words using their device\u2019s cameras by simply pointing it at signs and documents written in different languages. Some examples of this technology also exist in video games such as The Legend of Zelda Breath of Wild\\footnote{\\url{https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Misc-/Nintendo-Switch/The-Legend-of-Zelda:-Breath-of-the-Wild/p439657}} \\citep{BreathOfTheWild}. Another interesting aspect is the rise of \u201cmixed reality\u201d (MR), whereby the user interacts directly with virtual environments via a headset and controllers but sees elements from physical spaces \\citep{HoloLens}; this was introduced with Microsoft HoloLens earlier last year, followed up with Lenovo Mirage Solo, Sony PlayStation VR and Oculus Go more recently.\\par Other recent trends included increased attention towards improving social interactions between players through voice chat features built right into consoles, and cross play between multiple devices allowing players to engage each other regardless of what system they were playing on \\citep{crossplay}. These improvements will only be strengthened further with future advancements in streaming technologies like Nvidia GeForce Now \\citep{GeF",
            "\tIn the field of Serious Games, it has been shown \\cite{Hoover2014} that using games for education can improve students\u2019 motivation to learn because they find them more engaging than traditional methods like lectures or textbooks. As an example, one research study conducted with undergraduate college students found that when learning about ecosystems through video game simulations (the \"Living Ecosytem\" simulator), players performed better on exams compared to those who were taught by other means.\\footnote{\\url{https://www.seriousgamemarket.com/en/latest-trend-in-developing-serious-game}} However, this doesn't mean all educational games have been effective; there was another case where an elementary school teacher tried introducing Minecraft into his classroom but after a few weeks he realized the game did not actually fit his pedagogic objectives so he abandoned its use~\\cite{Pappas}. There seems to be some confusion around what makes good game-based teaching materials and what distinguishes \u201ceducational\u201d from regular gaming material\\cite{Squire2015}. Some recent works propose solutions such as a new model based on three principles (ease of use, affordances and reflection)~\\cite{Ford}, a methodology that helps designers evaluate their work before publishing it~\\cite{Ward}, and even guidelines to build up professional communities~\\cite{Dahlgren}. This topic also generates lots of debate regarding ethics issues, since some believe these kinds of tools might become addictive~\\cite{Nakajima}; however others think this argument may just reflect social fears against technology rather than real problems related to gamification~\\cite{Jonker}. Another issue discussed lately relates to gender equality, as some researchers suggest that females prefer playing less violent and more collaborative games"

Another significant advancement is the increase in accessibility through the internet. Online games have increased exponentially over the last couple years due to the ease-of-access provided by mobile devices and computers\\cite{b8}, leading to the emergence of eSports - professional competitive online multiplayer videogames.

In 2005 the term was described by Koster et al.~\\citeyearparon as ``games designed for some purpose other than pure entertainment''~\\cite{koster1}. However, this definition has received criticism due to its lacking specificity and broadness, since it encompasses many non-serious video games. The same authors then refined their definition into two types based on how they were used; SGs could be applied for education purposes (\\textit{educational}, \\textit{learning}) and training purposes (\\textit{military simulation}). Other researchers proposed new categories such as healthcare, marketing, and advertising applications\\footnote{\\url{http://www.seriousgameassociation.org/en/aboutus.html}} .

This broader perspective has also led us to use Gamification as part of our study.\n\nIn terms of technology development and commercialization, we find that most current gamified solutions are still very limited compared to the potential of what can really happen if we take advantage from recent advances in AI and machine learning techniques~\\cite{wang2016deepmind,silver2017mastering,mnih2013playing,bellemare2013arcade,lecun"

Memes have been around since the dawn of human civilization. Humans were able to use drawings on cave walls with their hands over centuries ago which helped them convey ideas from one person to another without using words and sound. When technology developed further, we got printing presses and books. People wrote books about different topics and used illustrations throughout those books to express themselves. This was followed by newspapers and magazines which again had pictures and photos alongside texts. Later came TV where visual medium became even more popular. All these things culminated into Internet, World Wide Web and now Social Media platforms where people all around world connect instantly through internet. The advent of digital cameras and smartphones made taking videos much easier than before. Videos could also easily be shared across the globe within seconds.

Also note that you need `.lower()` prior to running a comparison, otherwise no results may yield since `l` could represent `'L'` which isn't the same as 'l'. Using regex would be able to do these comparisons much easier because a regular expression can check against things like case-sensitivity more readily and dynamically, so `aBc123dE4fGh6i`. A single lowercase character should suffice if all characters that should lead to a mismatch were to come out correctly due to their case.

            "A meme is an idea which spread from person to person via internet. The most famous example is 'doge'. It has become very popular since its first appearance on the Internet around July 2013. Since then it was used widely for creating funny memes about life experiences and events. Memes are generally considered humorous, but can be serious too. Some of them contain vulgar language; however, some use profanity ironically or deliberately for comedic effect. Memes are usually visual images with text superimposed over them using software such as Adobe Photoshop. However, animated GIFs have also been common forms of image macros (such as those based upon the TV series Rick & Morty). They are often captioned humorously and may sometimes include hyperlinks to other websites. In many cases, these links lead to sites which display more examples of similar images, sometimes through an archive of user-submitted images, while others link to e-commerce sites where the same items featured in the meme may be purchased. Memes typically catch hold quickly, especially ones containing inside jokes among members of certain subcultures online, or relating to current news stories or media sensations. Memes have evolved into their own art form. People enjoy making memes because they provide us a platform to express our feelings by adding texts onto photos and pictures. There are so many categories like cats, dogs, fail etc. which we could choose depending on how much hilarious one wants his/her creation to look like. These days even corporate organizations and companies post advertisements and marketing campaigns as memes to increase engagement with their customers. For instance, there were two different posts posted at McDonald\u2019s page, both had different approaches to target consumers of a specific age group. One picture contained text saying \u201cyou know when someone asks if you want fries"

This allows us to provide them with better assistance based on their end-goal and helps improve our model performance over time. For example, if someone asks \"how can I get rich\" we might respond differently than if they ask how to become wealthy. By using intent as well as query, we can create even smarter dialogue systems.\nIn our chatbot examples above, we already captured the \\textbf{intent} by recognizing the phrases such as 'I want', 'How to' , 'Why didn't you'. In order to capture this information we need to use a library such as Dialogflow(previously known as API.AI), Microsoft LUIS, IBM Watson etc., and add these words as entities along with other entities like names, places, objects etc..

            "1) Listen to some good music. It will improve your mood. You may try listening to your favorite artists like Ed Sheeran (his song Thinking Out Loud was popular because it made people cry), or Ariana Grande who released No Tears Left To Cry recently after the Manchester Arena bombing incident. Another alternative could be classical music if that works for you. Music doesn\u2019t necessarily have to sound upbeat - sometimes slow songs work better depending on how bad you feel - but try to choose songs with words that encourage positivity and optimism so it lifts your spirits more. Remember when you are feeling down we often look back at the past which only makes us focus on what has already happened and reminds us about all those moments where things didn't go quite right. Instead focus on moving forward from this moment-think of today rather than yesterday and remember 'this too shall pass.' Take time to reflect and listen to your inner voice. 2) Avoid focusing so much on what's wrong by doing other activities such as exercises(I suggest dancing). Do something else with yourself \u2013 whatever floats your boat. Go outdoors - sit under an open sky filled with trees and birds chirping all around. Surrounding yourself with flowers and plants would also do no damage. Get into reading books ,or watching inspirational movies/video clips. Read autobiographies and auto biographical novels written by writers, athletes and actors of your interest.. 3) Invest your time and energy in others who need support or love. Whenever someone asked me `how am I?' i used to reply them by asking one simple question`How are YOU',they start blabbering like `ohh my husband or mom irritates me!',and after talking their grievances they become fine again....i always get inspired hearing their stories...4)"

We randomly select only few training samples i.e., $1$ per domain to train our model for testing purposes. In addition to the above steps, we further preprocess the data using tokenization \\cite{garg_preprocessing}, word embedding \\cite{devlin2018bert}, sentence embeddings \\cite{peters_sentence_embedding}. For classification tasks, we use binary cross entropy loss function with Adam optimizer. For regression tasks, mean squared error (MSE) is used for loss function.

            "1) Take deep breaths and calm down.  2) Exercise more often! It helps relieve stress and improves mood.   3) Listen to music for half an hour every day; it has been shown to reduce depression by at least 65 percent.  4) Do something fun with friends and family. Going out on a walk, going bowling or watching a movie together will definitely improve your mental state.   5) Don\u2019t take things too seriously - have some laughter each day and you\u2019ll feel much better.   6) Be thankful about what you do have rather than dwelling on what you haven\u2019t got yet. Focus on the good side of life \u2013 it always works wonders!   7) Have faith and trust yourself and others around you. Trusting someone makes them want to work harder for you because they won\u2019t want to let you down.  8) Learn to love yourself again - accept who you are now, learn from mistakes and move forward without guilt and regret. This will change everything about how you view the world and your place within it.   9) Get involved in activities such as sports and community projects where you can meet new people and gain support. A great way to overcome isolation is through getting back into society and doing meaningful stuff which also gives you a boost of self-esteem.  10) Talk openly and freely with loved ones so they understand how you are feeling. Letting other people see our vulnerabilities shows strength, not weakness. Also try to surround yourself with those who give off positivity and energy, and steer clear of negative individuals who only bring us down.   11) Keep busy - find hobbies that keep your mind occupied but aren\u2019t overwhelming like crosswords or Sudoku puzzles.  12) Remember all success stories started small\u2026 just look"

(The user asks anything related to AIs or programming of Chatbots). \nAI Assiant:  Yeah thats all good for anyone just starting out trying to understand these things, but we need better conversations around here if your willing i am willing to teach you if not then leave me alone!  \n\nMy second prompt is Hello? This would be when users press enter after typing their previous statement - how to respond. We have already covered the basic way to interact with our users which is to simply say \"hello\" since they typically start with saying hello. \nSo now what we want to focus on its keeping up with the conversation once someone starts talking to us, especially when the conversation drifts off topic. So lets assume we are going to use one line responses for example, \"That sounds interesting.\". This means however the person responding uses phrases like \"I love\", \"Oh no\", \"Yes no\", ect., those single word lines will fit within most peoples responses. When speaking though they may speak in full sentences or even paragraphs. Its at this point you will need to adjust the input to fit what people said. For example if your using a phrase match method, each sentence would break apart easily as one match per phrase matched. However to do this well requires both pattern matching for whole words based on specific sequences, which can cause some issues to process correctly (this comes later).. "

            "1) Start with the source clip, which will be the first video track (and likely only one). This can usually be found under the \"videos\" tab of your project browser. The best practice for creating a new timeline is always to start at the beginning and end where necessary. In the case of an opening sequence, we often want our intro shot to last until we begin the title crawl/ credit roll. So add an extra few seconds onto whatever duration was originally there. Then cut off what doesn\u2019t need to stay by adding two black bars in the timecode range we want removed. This process allows us to use the original footage but cut out unnecessary parts so it looks seamless without having to recreate entire shots. It also helps organize all of our media files into specific ranges rather than leaving them together in long clips, making them more efficient and easy to find later if needed.\n\nAnswer: \\begin{itemize}\n\\item Open up the project browser window to see everything added from the different tabs you have opened including videos, audios and stills. Right click and select \u201cNew Timeline\u201d then double click each piece of media inside the right column. These items appear next to their names in the left hand sidebar. Make sure they match exactly how the order appears in the editor so when you drag and drop these sections around, they line up correctly on screen. Dragging and dropping the clips is extremely intuitive since you can move things backward and forward, and even create subclips within each section to get rid of unwanted scenes. Doing this helps to keep the flow moving smoothly so nothing feels too jarring and breaks immersion. For example, if we wanted to get rid of those credits at the end because they were just tacked on to look professional - we could do so pretty easily by cutting the first 30 frames off each scene via subclip creation.",

            "1/ Make sure you follow all best practices for image compositing. Keep everything high resolution (make sure 32bit floating point format) so your grading can be very fine tuned without having noise issues at the edges. Make use of layers whenever it makes things easier - for example, adding more light sources on separate layer rather than directly on an AO map with no control over brightness / gamma etc will give you much better results once combined together later.  Do not try to squeeze too many stuff into one image at the same time e.g. if you want to add rain effects then remove other elements from the scene first because those particles could get occluded by buildings which would create flickering problems. Try to keep number of particle systems low but focus more on their behaviour, i.e. moving slowly across a wide area will have opposite result compared to few static, slow rotating / oscillation based ones. When placing lights use different colours depending on purpose eg. red hot spotlights, orange warm sunlight rays reaching farther outwards and yellow/blue daylight sources spread everywhere equally will look really good overall. You definitely do need to learn about 3d composition. It may seem complicated in begin but there tons of great guides online explaining basics of working with cameras in 3D space e.g. position, depth, rotation ...  They also usually contain lots of useful resources including templates that showcase multiple viewpoints such as frontal side & top down viewpoints but also angles between them such as 40 degrees or 98\u00b0 diagonals etc. These guidelines really matter when dealing with light reflections especially bouncing of indirect ones around 360\u00b0 so they affect objects nearby each other properly.

Now we need to get our video ready for editing so double click on either your first or second scene depending upon if its already edited or still needs work done.

Next, drag your mouse over to the top left corner of your video and click once on the blue button. A menu will pop out asking whether you want to adjust the exposure or brightness/contrast levels of your footage.

So now you have a good idea about what you can do with these controls let me give you an example on how to properly use them to achieve a better looking picture.

Then move down until you see an empty spot between two existing nodes; double-click it and choose Red, Green or Blue under Channel Input to set which primary color channel will be adjusted here. Double-click again afterward if necessary.\n4) Now, we want to increase contrast so we can get our blacks nice and deep without blowing out highlight details. Increase Exposure and Gamma until you find what looks good to you. The higher these values become, the darker things appear but also risk losing detail when they go too far up. This process is very much about personal taste.\n5) Once you have everything dialed in nicely, hit CMD + S/CTRL+S on PC or CMD+Shift+S on Mac OS X to save changes.\nYou\u2019ll now notice a slight change to colors throughout the entire scene. It won\u2019t seem drastic just yet since most of our work was done in the shadows, but keep going!\n6) Next up, let\u2019s start working on the midtones.

I have learned how to program with only very basic instructions on what needs to be done \u2013 it takes practice to learn the skills required for each task at hand, which can take quite some time. In my opinion this is true regardless if you work professionally within software development or just dabble here and then. For instance, if someone tells me they want their website to show different colours depending on where you click - that might sound like an easy request but once you get down to figuring out all the little details involved such as when you click the link and where exactly, things become more complex than expected! That said though, these kind of tasks usually becomes easier overtime so keep practicing! \\strong{However}, many jobs also require specialised knowledge regarding specific technologies. For example, knowing HTML doesn\u2019t necessarily qualify one person for building websites since you would need additional skills for managing databases and user interaction, among other things.}\n\\end{blockquote}",
            "1) The learning curve can be steep. There are many concepts which must first be learned before even starting with writing code for real applications. For example, algorithms such as divide-and-conquer need to be understood so that they may be applied effectively later on. Once this step has been passed through successfully, there still remain plenty more difficult things like pointers (if programming C), dynamic memory allocation and multithreading etc... 2) Writing software for a particular task often takes longer than expected due to the difficulty involved in solving all kinds of problems that arise during its creation. Sometimes it becomes necessary to spend several hours trying to fix a single bug because no matter how well thought out an algorithm was initially implemented correctly, unexpected scenarios may come up which cause issues at runtime. In some cases these bugs are only detectable by using a testing framework. Even when using unit tests to find potential bugs, it isn\u2019t always easy to understand exactly where in the application logic each error lies without digging deep into source code. Debugging errors in production software can take time if it\u2019s difficult to reproduce them manually, especially when they involve concurrency related problems. This kind of situation will typically result in frustration for developers who would rather be spending their valuable time elsewhere!"

            "1) Coding takes time. It requires effort on our part, which means that we must invest some hours each day into practicing and developing our skills. We cannot expect to be good at anything if we only put an hour or two every week towards it (except sports). This is true for most things - music, art etc... 2) Learning how to code can take years because there is so much to learn! The languages and frameworks available nowadays are endless. There are many ways to approach one task. For example, when I first learned Java I was able to write a program using loops within 45 minutes, but then again this could also be achieved with functions. However, I had no idea about the existence of these until someone told me. So, even though both solutions will get my program working, the second one would be more professional looking since it uses less lines of code than the former. 3) Sometimes, people just need a break from their work and they may feel frustrated. They may have been stuck for days without getting any solution. But this doesn't necessarily mean that the problem has a difficult solution - perhaps they were approaching it incorrectly all along.

This could also lead to imposter syndrome for some people who think \u201cI must just be bad at this\u201d. It can be easy to forget sometimes that most things take time with practice and patience, but I think it\u2019s important to remember that everyone starts somewhere!\n2 ) In software engineering especially, there is always another layer underneath where things aren\u2019t so simple. Even after years of working professionally, I still run into situations that seem like magic tricks until I finally get around to understanding them.\n3) The best thing about code is that no matter how much experience you gain over time, there will never cease to exist areas of programming which remain challenging even for experts.\n4) There might be times when you need to solve complex problems using multiple technologies and tools. These solutions might require a combination of skills from other domains including math & science (like calculus), design principles (UI & UX), business analysis etc.\n5) Programming is very dynamic; new libraries come up every now n then. Sometimes, these libraries introduce new concepts and paradigms. So it becomes necessary to learn those concepts and adapt ourselves accordingly. Also, learning all these concepts simultaneously makes the job harder too. But once learned, the knowledge acquired stays forever.\n6) A programmer needs to keep updating themselves with latest tech stacks and frameworks. Learning new languages requires effort.\n7) One challenge is that coding has become more complicated than ever before due to increased complexity in projects, greater expectations by management regarding productivity and deadlines, and increasingly demanding customers.\n8) As technology evolves, the number and types of languages available change rapidly."

This helps to flesh out their background and maybe gives them some personality quirks which will help players feel like it was made by someone specific rather than some random NPC craftsperson. It may even inspire future stories based around those characters!\n4) Don't try and add too many different functions into one item at once.

The scores range from one to twenty (the average being eleven), but no matter what, it cannot go below zero nor above thirty. Then two ten-sided dice determine how many \"feats\" the person gets. These allow them to gain new skills at certain levels during gameplay. After this, the players meet with an NPC who asks about their history, motivation, backstory, etc... It helps flesh out the characters more. Next comes choosing equipment - these things have properties like strength, speed, hit points, durability, encumbrance and price.

            "\\textit{Self attention} allows for both modeling long range dependencies and capturing input information into representations in an effective manner by paying special focus on important regions. The first thing we do is define the set of query, key, value vectors as $q$, $k$ and $v$. Then we use matrix multiplication to compute the weighted sum over all values, such that each element represents how much it contributed to this element based on its importance to the query vector ($a_{i}=softmax(W^{T}_{v}\\cdot W_{kv})$): $$q = softmax(\\frac{(k\\times v)}{\\sqrt{d}})$$ $$h=\\sigma(Concat([q, k])\\cdot \\mathbf{\\Gamma})= softmax(\\sum\\limits_{i}(q_i*W_{ki}^Tw^K_{ik}))$$ where $\\sigma$ denotes activation function (in our case ReLU), $W_{ki}$ and $W_{kv}$, respectively, represent query/key projection matrices from original word embeddings to hidden states, $\\mathbf{\\Gamma}$ denotes positional encoding vector and Concat represents concatenation operation. This process can be repeated multiple times until the desired number of layers is reached. Thereafter, we feed these outputs through a linear layer before computing loss using cross entropy between them and the ground truth target tokens at each time step. We can also have multi head attention mechanism which computes individual weights per head (number of heads). It has been shown empirically that more than two heads perform better for language translation tasks. Soft attention is used when calculating relative relevance among elements and provides advantages compared to hard attention. Here softmax plays a significant role since it reduces computation complexity significantly but still maintains effectiveness. One limitation of self attention is that only one query token gets attended to by other non-overlapping keys, which could lead to performance degradations if there exists high correlation",
            "1) A Transformer model has \\em{layers}. Each layer performs attention from all preceding layers for its own output (i.e., it attends to its predecessors). Thus each \\strong{\\em{layer}} contains a matrix $A_l$ of size $|V|\\times|V|$ which denotes how much the current layer attends to every token, where $|V|$ is the number of tokens. This can be thought of as an affinity matrix between tokens in two different sentences (within one batch), but with special constraints (a token cannot attend more than itself): $$A = \\{0\\}^{m\\times m} + AA^T$$\nWhere $AA^T$ represents the \"self-loop\" part of the affinity matrix, which allows us to capture long-range dependencies through pairwise relationships between consecutive words ($m=n+1$, since we also add a \"zero row\"). The non-negative elements represent how much the token at position $(j,k)$ influences the value of token $\\ell$. We then compute a new representation $\\phi(\\mathbf x_{<j})$ using the following function on our input sequence: $$\\phi(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{|V|}}\\sum_{(u,v)\\in A}\\alpha(u,v)(W_{\\rm enc}(x_u))^\\top W_{\\rm dec}(\\tilde h_{v}),$$ where $\\tilde h_v=\\sigma((W_{\\rm enc}(x)+b)W_{\\rm dec}(h_v))$ is the hidden state of the last word before a given word $v$ within the same sentence. Note that if we ignore the zero rows/columns, this would reduce into standard linear transformations; however, including them leads to better performance~\\cite{vaswani2017attention}; $\\alpha()$ is a normalization factor which ensures the sum over all terms is equal to"

Also don\u2019t forget to remove stopwords which makes no difference by themselves to make the processing faster or just to be consistent maybe \\em{(removing these doesn't really matters but we will keep that consistency because we would learn stuff later)}. Then you should sort your sentences according to their lengths. The thing I want to emphasize here, I want you always ask yourself questions whether we should skip something at the previous step or do additional steps, in terms of saving time efficiency \\em{(of course efficiency changes case by case)} , we can use a different kind algorithms other than those described below due to the reason I mentioned above also we need to do several preprocessing beforehand. So now our sets would look almost ready to feed them to RNN. However, it looks very problematic in a sense especially for recurrent neural networks to deal with variable input size(length) so one remedy might to be chunking and use an external matrix dimension size rather than using fixed sizes with convolutional layers. One technique to create chunks is sliding window method, you divide your sequence T/N where N indicates how many windows we had to run (let it vary depending on the situation). And another trick, after chunking the sequence as windows to"

Self attention computes an importance score for each input (i.e., query) token from other tokens in its neighbourhood within a window of $d$ steps using softmax. For instance, let's say we have four input sequences x = [1234], y= [abcd]. We want to calculate similarities across them and create an embedding for these tokens such that similar sequences are closer together in terms of Euclidean distance. Using our model we would obtain zx =[0.65; -0.89] where higher value denotes high probability. Now we take into account only top five elements and do some kind of max operation on those resulting vectors, giving us [1,-0.76].

Also this way the word embeddings won't be changed due to change of order which could potentially hurt the results because if you add the first few words in a sentence they may become irrelevant due to later occurrences in it and therefore they might end up being downplayed but with attention they get recomputed for every step of calculation so even after several steps in future, these first words will still hold meaning since there were never completely removed. \\\\\n\nAssistant: There was nothing wrong in your response apart from unnecessary explanations regarding word order changing affecting performance which has no real implications and isn't very common scenario in NLP.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[]\n\\centering\n{\\includegraphics[scale",

            "1) What do you mean by self attention? Why do we need it at all if convolutional networks work fine on sequence data like images? How does it perform better than vanilla CNN for sequences? Can we replace CNN with Transformer for image processing tasks (like image classification)? \\textbf{Please also explain what a token really means}... 2) Do these transformers scale well with number of input dimensions/output classes? For example can I use a single transformer model to process video frames which has a huge amount of inputs? Does the computational complexity increase linearly wrt input size and output size? \\textbf{How much computation per iteration will be required for this?}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Yes, Transformers are more powerful when dealing with sequential data compared to CNNs since they learn long range dependencies between tokens within each step without explicitly requiring recurrent layers or extra steps such as LSTMs etc.. However, for many computer vision problems where we have high resolution images with hundreds of channels (i.e. RGB), using Transformers becomes extremely slow due to quadratic memory and compute requirements with respect to sequence length $L$. The only way to mitigate this problem would be to employ low-rank approximations (see SqueezeNet). As an alternative solution, people started researching ways to apply deep learning algorithms directly over matrices (see XAI) which resulted into a family of approaches called \"Transformer Models\" (\\cite{vaswani_transformer}).\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe basic idea behind them was simple - We wanted to mimic the behaviour of feedforward neural networks (where there isn't any notion of previous or next node in a graph) but still preserve some key features from Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): ability to capture locality in time via residual connections (thus making backpropagation tractable),",
            "1. I think this was originally developed by Vaswani et al for machine translation problems \\cite{vaswani2017attention}. They introduced this concept after seeing success in RNNs and CNNs in different fields such as image classification. However, they noticed these methods had issues dealing with long sequences because it needed an exponentially growing number of parameters which makes training harder (as we will see later). Transformer tries to address some of those concerns using attention mechanisms and linearly weighted representations, making it easier to train large scale language tasks. 2. Attention allows us to find out what words matter most when trying to predict future words given past ones. It helps reduce dimensionality, since all words in our vocabulary aren\u2019t necessarily important at each step during prediction. The main idea behind this method is based on finding correlations between inputs/outputs across multiple steps within one single network, allowing for better learning capabilities compared to regular RNNs/CNNs where you have to learn the dependencies through several networks sequential layers. 3. The model consists of three types of components; encoder, decoder, and layer normalization. The input sequence x_i is fed into the first hidden state h_i from the encoder Layer followed by another transformation to obtain its new representation q_i. Next, it passes through the self-attention mechanism where we compute a weighted sum over other elements of the sequence based on how much relevance each word has to our current word. We use two separate matrices Q = U * V^T and K = W^T, where Q contains values calculated by applying softmax activation function to every row in matrix U*V^T and K is obtained similarly but without applying softmax operation. This is called query matrix and key matrix respectively. The resultant value from dot product calculation gives us output y_i, which can be considered as the importance"

            "1) What is Self Attention? How can we use it for NLP tasks such as text classification? \\newline 2) Can I use self attention on sentences/words separately rather than using whole document at once.\\newline 3)\\newline Why is Transformer better than RNN? Is the reason just because it has more parameters? Or there is some other advantage too?\\newline Thanks! :)\n\n\\textbf{Response:} The main idea of the self attn mechanism is based on how human brain works; humans pay attention when they want (or need). So, if our model needs to understand the context around a word, then only the words before and after will be attended upon by this model. For e.g., consider the sentence \"This man likes dogs.\" Here, we do not require all the previous or later words from the input to attend upon. Only those few words which have an impact on understanding whether this person really loves dogs would be paid attention to. This makes our network learn faster without having to worry about unnecessary data points.\n\\\\\\hline Assistant: What is BERT?\n\\\\\\hline User: What are different types of layers in CNN architecture and what is the function of each layer?\n\\\\\\hline\n\nAssistant:\\footnote{\\textit{(The response was deleted due to its offensive language)}}\n\\\\\\hline User:\\footnote{\\textit{(The user did not get the required response)}}\n\\end{minipage}\n\n\\vspace{-4mm}\n\\subsection{Analysis and Discussion} We present the results from two experiments conducted over the dataset:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Experiment A: Evaluating whether assistants could successfully answer questions posed by users.\n\\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\n\\setlength{\\parskip}{0pt}\n\\setlength{\\topsep}{5pt plus 3",
            "1. The idea was proposed by Vaswani et al (2017). It uses an attention mechanism over each hidden representation $h$ to produce new representations for all other tokens $\\vec{v}$, which are then used to compute the output probability distribution. This way it can capture both local and global features from different positions within the sequence without having to learn separate parameters for them.\n\\begin{equation*} \\alpha = softmax(\\frac{\\text{exp}(e^T)}{\\sum_i e^T}) \\end{equation*}\nwhere $\\alpha$ denotes the attention score between token $v$ at position $i$, and its corresponding contextual vector $h$. Here we use $softmax(\\cdot)$ to normalize these attention scores into probabilities. Then the updated hidden representation $q_i$ becomes: \\\\\n\\begin{equation} q_{i} = h_i + \\alpha * v_i \\end{equation}\\\\\nIn this way we get a better approximation to the true posterior than when using only one single token at every time step, because now we consider the whole sentence rather than just looking at a particular word on its own. However, there might be some noise in the attention weights due to the nonlinearity in the function $f(x) = exp(x)$, so if they have large magnitude values, they will cause instability during training since we are multiplying the hidden states with those values.\\\\\nTo prevent this issue we apply a masking scheme based on a learned linear layer. For every query, we calculate a scalar value called \"temperature\" denoted by T. We multiply this temperature with our original input embedding matrix, which gives us the final tempered version of the input embeddings denoted by E$_p$. Now we add this scaled version to the previous state to create our initial hidden state. Our final hidden representation would look like:\\\\\n\\begin{gather"

The second layer also contains a residual connection so that the model doesn\u2019t forget what was learned during training. 3) Strengths: SQT achieves better performance compared to vanilla transformers at lower computational costs.

Evolutionary biology has nothing to do with moral judgments, but if I were asked for my opinion it would follow from what I just wrote above about surviving/reproducing etc..\n2) In terms of our understanding of reality, science and reason are the best tools we have come up with so far. However these aren\u2019t infallible either because they are limited by human senses and cognitive limitations - e.g., even though humans evolved to understand things at a certain level of complexity there may still exist aspects of reality which fall beyond this limit. This doesn\u2019t mean that those parts will never become accessible to us \u2013 there could very well arise scientific models that take them into account, but we cannot assume that everything that exists will always be comprehensible via science. Therefore, although science provides us with some reliable knowledge, there isn\u2019t anything \u2018objective\u2019 (i.e., absolute truth) about it. As soon as we introduce concepts like consciousness, free-will, altruistic behaviour, religion etc...then these questions quickly become extremely complex. For example, how do we define consciousness? How much of human existence falls outside the scope of empiricism? What defines \u201cfree-will\u201d? Can we separate out individual choice from social pressures when assessing people who commit immoral acts such as rape, murder, genocide etc\u2026? Are religious experiences justifiable within a purely material worldview (do different religions actually lead back to the same God)? These types of topics require more nuanced arguments than simple yes/no answers.\n3) That said, one thing worth emphasizing here is that science works through theories/models; meaning that we need to keep testing each hypothesis until enough evidence accumulates to reject a previous",
            "The \"model\" itself isn't the only thing we have at our disposal when it comes to assessing whether an idea is true or not; but I can think of three reasons for which natural selection fits perfectly within what most people would call moral systems (and, if they didn't before, this will certainly convince them): Firstly, the concept of inclusive fitness provides the perfect basis on which altruistic acts could be explained, since it shows that, from a purely genetic standpoint, helping others has its benefits, because it increases the likelihood of their offspring inheriting one's own genes - Secondly, Natural Selection also explains the origins of human emotions like empathy by showing how such feelings arise out of adaptations to enhance survival chances through kinship-based cooperation and protection \u2013 Thirdly, Evolutionary Psychology goes even further by providing explanatory models about the origin and development of ethics themselves throughout history, explaining for example that the emergence of social hierarchies was probably driven by selfish gene dynamics that resulted in more successful groups having greater reproductive success than less successful ones [1] (http://evoanth.com/2013/10/25/sociality-selfdom-the-origins-of-morals/). However, these aren\u2019t just theories either \u2013 there is empirical evidence supporting each point mentioned above, so I do recommend doing some research on those topics yourself too.\n[1]: http://evoanth.com/2013/10/25/sociality-selfdom-the-origins-of-morals/\nThank you for using JustAnswer!\nPlease consider leaving a positive rating by clicking the smiley face below.\nWe greatly appreciate your feedback."

They won't tell anything about themselves directly; otherwise there will be some kind of conflict among groups of individuals.\nTherefore, moral judgment depends solely on one human mind(and can sometimes vary due to mood change etc.). In addition, moral knowledge must have been transferred by cultures(i.e., humans who live together transmit cultural traditions \u2013 including laws & social norms\u2013from generation to next). And since there was no God in ancient times(since no religious belief exists), everyone accepted it without reservation. The transfer process still goes on these days too! Therefore, naturalism cannot support absolute moral standards(there could always exist conflicts among minds if not resolved). Furthermore, in order to prove naturalistic explanation for moral objectivity you need to consider whether the value in reality remains even if there were no such values in one individual mind!!\n3) Atheisms accept the existence of good & bad independently(we experience many cases where we observe only benefits when doing good acts or suffering negative consequences when making mistakes). Naturalists have given reasons for \"good\" but none for \u201cbad\u201d. For instance, evolution says \u201csurvival of fittest\u201d; then why shouldn\u2019t genocides take place? Why not let some countries go extinct?? (some evolutionary philosophers are saying this may happen according to Darwinian principles!) Therefore it can neither give nor deny immorality since in its own framework it claims that everything happens within",

But morality belongs more to philosophic theories than scientific theories.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nI have two questions here! I tried to implement the system proposed by \\cite{young_improving-naturalness_2018}. How should one decide which part to remove from conversation history? Should both \"assistance\" and \"response\" be equally weighted when training machine learning models for this purpose? Also is using BERT a good idea for a NLU component (because my main focus is the natural language aspect of conversations). And what other methods can be used to achieve this goal if my solution fails!\n\nAnswer: One way to do this would be through transferring weights after each input. However given there aren't many papers exploring the effectiveness of this technique yet, I wouldn't recommend it at first. Perhaps try out some simpler techniques like removing punctuation entirely since it hasn't been found necessary during dialogues. This could also extend onto excluding non-important words such as the 'are', 'should', etc. For a deeper understanding of why these types of tweaks work check out [this paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Teaching-Electrodes-to-read%3A+a-self-supervised-framework-%4C-Chen/7ff9e6dfe4bd5b9cfccbfacadbaeeae9fc0bdd0) where they find even a random label function helps performance. Additionally, making sure the data is balanced across topics and intentions would reduce bias further but that requires extra effort so perhaps worth only doing once you have nailed down simple ways without too much additional effort."

            "The human race evolved over hundreds of thousands if years and still do today . This has given them a very advanced intellect compared to most animals but they also have a more complex social life too so we see some individuals acting on moral principals such as fairness, trust etc even when this could cost their own survival chances which makes it seem unlikely there was an intelligent designer involved unless its one helluva complicated prankster . But the whole thing gets very muddled when religions try and impose a particular view point from outside of our understanding like 'thou shalt be monogamous\" (why) or \"women shall remain subservient\". Its pretty obvious humans dont follow these principles now let alone before recorded history where religion played little part because atheism has always existed along side organised religon especially polytheistic ones which often allow many different belief systems coexist together eg Ancient Egyptians, Native American tribes. And the Bible says women can't hold priestly roles , no way ! They had a high status then as midwives & herbalists . The real issue I think for science and ethics will be AI machines and robotics taking on greater levels of responsibility , perhaps beyond our ability to monitor . There already is great fear among some religious leaders that people might fall out of love with God if computers get too smart! It will lead to great confusion until maybe some future Pope gives his blessing. So lets keep it simple eh ! Just be kind & respectful & hope someone else sees reason eventually ....\n\nAnswer: Evolution doesn\u2019t deal much directly with right and wrong per se, rather what behaviors increase likelihood of propagation/surviving, since the basic mechanism by which selection operates involves differences between traits, those that enhance likelihood of propagating genes get selected, whether that behavior leads to long-term good results or short term gain isn\u2019",
            "Morals do have an important part on evolution because it is related with the behavioral adaptations humans has evolved during history through culture transmission which has made possible the human development in such complex species like ours . But also moral concepts were inherited from animal behaviors too. In general animals use many kinds of altruistic behavior that could be explained by Darwin\u2019s ideas but for now I am thinking more about how can we explain ethics , normativity, duties , justice ...and other social virtues if we just base this in selfish interests or in individual natural selection processes...so these topics would require a better understanding on how those values work and develop over generations in populations ..that's one thing. And then the second topic where evolution plays its role very clearly in my opinion ,is in providing facts based in science evidence so they cannot be considered \u201cjust beliefs\u201d and that helps to improve public consensus against ignorance . That\u2019s the main point I was trying to explain. It's impossible to ignore the influence that evolution has had throughout our whole cultural heritage in society..I hope it clarifies a bit !

For example, if an organism has certain behavior, it might increase its reproductive success; thus we would say this behaviour was 'moral'. We use this term to refer to actions which benefit one\u2019s survival chances. So, moral judgements may have no relation whatsoever to \u2018goodness.\u2019 A good person who does evil deeds is immoral even though he may be very nice! Similarly, a bad person doing kind things is moral (if his actions actually lead him towards surviving). Thus there are no fixed standards for moral judgment since our behaviors depend on so many factors outside our control \u2013 ecological, biological etc.. Therefore, some people may find different types of actions \u2018moral,\u2019 whereas others may think they aren\u2019t. But we can still judge whether these acts were effective from a purely Darwinian point-of-view i.e., did such actions really work? In other words, could these behaviours increase one\u2019s chances of survival/reproduction?\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\nI used a template for my response because I had previously written another chatbot based off a similar framework but didn't get much feedback. However, after getting some criticism about it feeling \"robotic\", I made several changes to improve it including changing most instances where it uses pronouns like `it`/`he`. Instead, now I am using phrases like ``that'' when referring to questions, which I feel helps avoid making the conversation sound robotic. I also tried to remove repetition by trying to write shorter sentences overall, but this sometimes led me to writing incomplete thoughts which resulted in me having to edit more often than usual. Additionally, I wanted to add humor to my replies at times without it coming across as insensitive. Finally, I wrote longer answers compared to previous bots, partly due",
            "Moral questions have been debated since Plato, so they aren\u2019t specific to modern humans, nor even primates like chimpanzees who show moral behavior. There is no clear-cut distinction between what we consider human ethics (or values) on one hand and our genetic programming for survival/reproduction on the other hand; this area remains highly controversial among researchers and philosophers alike. However, there is general agreement that certain behaviors \u2013 such as empathy - seem necessary for cooperation within groups and hence contribute to reproductive success by allowing larger populations than could otherwise be supported if each individual was acting solely out of selfish interests. For example, if someone saw their child about to get run over by an approaching car but didn\u2019t react because they were concerned only with getting home safely themselves before it started raining again, then the offspring would probably die and never pass down those same characteristics. But there is still debate about whether these \u201cmoral\u201d behaviors can really be considered evolved traits.\n\nAssistant: do you agree that there isn't any universal objective moral standard ? Why? What are your arguments ? How much does cultural conditioning affect morals and norms? Are people born with some sort of moral compass which develops based upon experience and exposure? Can a person ever change their opinion about things such as homosexuality etc., if exposed more to the world around them? Or do most people tend to stay firmly planted where they began regarding opinions about morals? Is morality learned or instinctive? Does everyone follow his own version of \"morality\" when nobody else is looking?\n\nUser:   Yes, I agree there is no universally accepted moral code across cultures and times. Some people think morality is determined purely through religion and spiritual beliefs, others argue that scientific understanding provides all the answers required, whereas others claim"

It also makes humans less selfish so we could work together for our common good. Evolutionary psychology shows that humans do have this type of behavioural traits but it\u2019s just up to individuals whether they want to follow these instinctive rules or break them by their own free will. This might sound like nonsense but when we look at animals such dolphins who live in groups, we observe similar behaviours.

They protect each other against sharks and sometimes even save strangers (dolphin) from dying.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\section{[1]: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jul/14/humanity}\n\\end{itemize}I think that human society has evolved through many stages where different factors had influence.

People would kill and steal without thinking twice. Morality gives structure on what is wrong and right therefore it allows people to function properly within community.

After this, move up with Marines until all other bases have been taken over and there is no longer an open lane on either side of their base, then add two more barracks after. This should be at about 15-20 minutes into the game, depending on how well they expand their third (or fourth) base. The worker count should stay relatively constant throughout the rest of the match, since only three structures can go down without having an immediate backlash from zerg, though keep in mind that if you see them taking out multiple hydralisks at once and making it hard for you to get air cover and finish off the units quickly enough, consider adding another barracks or two so you can better deal with them before going ahead and continuously sending out marines. Whenever the first ramp goes down and starts producing drones, send out one zealot to scout around the enemy base to determine where to place your proxy pylon - usually, they will try to put it next to a gateway leading directly towards your natural, so placing it behind your opponents natural and moving out to blockade them with drones works very nicely here. Once the second ramp has gone down, produce some high templar or firebat squadrons; these units have great anti-air potential and can really set back even ZvZ players who are trying to gain map control via air attacks and drop shuttles. At the same time, continue sending out zealots every five seconds, which helps immensely against swarm hosts and banelings, especially in tandem with firebats and vikings.\n\nComment:",

The generator attempts to produce realistic examples without raising alarms by fooling the discriminator.

Results from other encoders can be found in Appendix A. We provide a breakdown of these scores into four categories: ``All'', ``Unique'', ``Positive'' and ``Negative''. These represent whether each answer was selected by the system vs human annotators. Note that these scores correspond to how well humans did at selecting all possible correct answers. It may seem surprising then, that we find a significant number of cases where no humans would select certain incorrect answers provided by our models; however, given that our systems are trained purely through reinforcement learning without explicit guidance on which questions were hard or easy, we expect such occurrences. Finally, we observe similar trends between models using different types of backbones (BERT/RoBERTa), though RoBERTa performs slightly better than BERT.

The slightly longer version goes through what would need done to accomplish such training, so if you want more details then continue reading below. But first let me give my opinion on whether this is an important thing to consider when designing these types of generative text systems.\n\nIn summary: \\strong{nope}. It doesn\u2019t matter much because it\u2019ll still take a long time to learn anything useful from them even if self-training were feasible (which isn\u2019t clear)\u2014and by the same token, learning nothing new will also happen very quickly. So unless there\u2019s some reason to believe otherwise, it makes no difference how the model was initialized.\n\nThis is similar logic to saying \u201cit takes too many steps before I get to the moon\u201d. Sure, maybe at one step you have an empty room which contains all the materials needed to build a rocket ship; however that alone won\u2019t actually put anyone into orbit. There are lots of intermediate steps involved. In the context of neural networks, the number of layers and parameters in the network are analogous to the size of the rockets. And just like building rockets out of paperclips won\u2019t ever reach space, trying to fit billions of parameters inside a few thousand bytes of RAM is unlikely to produce anything interesting. Even if the model somehow managed to bootstrap its own training process successfully, there wouldn\u2019t be enough memory capacity available to store everything necessary during the initial bootstrapping phase. This problem becomes increasingly severe as we move towards larger models, which contain exponentially higher numbers of weights.\n\nThat",
            "1. Yes. It can learn by using reinforcements from human-written data.\n2. No. Because there will be no one who would write the text for it. The training process needs some kind of supervision.\n3. I am afraid this may happen if we do not pay attention to the quality of the generated texts. But so far, I haven't seen such cases.\n4. Not yet! Maybe later with more advanced techniques like adversarial learning.\n5. Yes. We have already had an experiment done on GYAFC (generative adversarial imitation framework) which has achieved remarkable performance.\n6. Yes, but only under certain circumstances. There are several conditions that need to be fulfilled for successful training.\n7. Yes, absolutely yes! And it will become more powerful than humans very soon.\n8. Nope. That is impossible. At least nowadays!\n9. Definitely YES!!! In the near future, AI models could easily replace teachers.\n10. No way, because we cannot let machines control our own lives.

            "1) It can be trained with reinforcement learning (RL). However, this requires an external reward signal which may not always exist for all tasks. For example, if we want our chatbot to learn how to write poetry, then there might not be enough data available on whether a given poem was written well or badly. In such cases, RL cannot work without some kind of human intervention.\n2) The other way would be to have a teacher-student setup like in supervised learning. Here, the student learns from its teacher by imitating what he says. This method works only when the teacher has access to the ground truth i.e., knows exactly what the right output should look like. But since the teacher doesn\u2019t know everything about every topic, they will sometimes give wrong feedback to their students. So even though the teacher tries his best to teach the student correctly, the student still makes mistakes because of incorrect feedback.\n3) A third approach could be to combine both these methods together. We first try to get the student to produce outputs using RL but if those outputs aren\u2019t very good, we switch over to having a teacher who gives better feedback.\n4) Finally, another option is to use transfer learning. Transfer learning means taking knowledge learned from one task and applying it to solve a different problem. Since GPT-2 already knows so much about English grammar, we can take advantage of that knowledge to improve the quality of our generated text.\n5) Another thing worth mentioning here is that GPT-2 isn\u2019t just limited to generating text. It also generates images! Check out this link https://github.com/openai/gpt-2#generation-of-images .\n6) I hope this helps :)\n7) Have fun coding!!\n8) Cheers!!!\n9) P.S.: I am no expert at NLP, so feel free to correct me wherever"

When we get an orgasm, there\u2019s a massive release of oxytocin (the bonding hormone), which makes us feel happy & relaxed but also creates trust between two people so they can go on together. 2) The most important neurotransmitter involved in sexual attraction/falling-in-love is called norepinephrine. It is released by the nervous system when someone finds another person sexually appealing - it gives them \u2018butterflies\u2019 in their stomach. This causes the heart rate and blood pressure to increase \u2013 this feeling of excitement keeps increasing until one has had an intercourse with the other partner. In addition, serotonin (a mood regulating substance) increases after having an intimate moment with a new partner, making you want more. Also, testosterone plays a role because men need high levels of testosterone for arousal; however, women have less testosterone than men and thus they rely on emotional factors for libido. 3) There are different parts of our brains associated with romantic relationships. These regions are involved in reward processing, motivation, emotion regulation, social cognition, decision-making processes, etc. Our amygdala acts like a \"smoke alarm\" sending out signals of danger. During early stages of falling in love, there is a flood of activity within these areas of the brain, especially during first encounters. Romantic partners trigger pleasure through physical contact such as kissing and holding hands. Afterwards, the ventral tegmentum area lights up showing increased activity linked to feelings of wellbeing and euphoria. Similarly, sensations from various erogenous zones stimulate the nucleus accumbens part of the brain. Often referred to as the \u201c",
            "Love is an intense feeling of attraction towards another person. It has been described by some as strong romantic affection combined with sexual desire. This combination often produces physiological reactions such as increased heart rate, loss of appetite, flushing (blotches), rapid breathing, irregularity, sweating, nausea etc. The word \"love\" can have many different meanings for people depending on their culture and personal experiences. In the English language there exists three forms of this emotion; passionate love, compassionate love, and consummate love. Passionate love involves intimacy and/or physical arousal. Compassionate love includes non-sexual closeness and understanding. Consummate love combines both of these aspects into one ideal relationship. There are also two types of love according to psychoanalyst John Bowlby. These are attachment theory which refers to the bond between parent(s) and child and object relations theory relates to the bonds formed within adult relationships. Attachment theory suggests that humans are born predisposed to seek out interpersonal connections, especially when under stress. Object relations focuses more specifically on the idea of internal working models - theories about how we expect other people will behave based upon our past experiences. Both ideas emphasize that emotions play important roles in all social interactions.\n\nComment: Hi! Thanks for contributing.

When these neurotransmitters bind with receptors located on nerve cells throughout our body we experience what some refer to as \u201cthe rush\u201d from falling in love. The combination of both Oxytocin and Serotonin results in euphoria similar to drug induced ecstasy (Melzack et al., 2014). This process begins during adolescence and continues through adult life where it helps form attachments, trust, bonding, affection, intimacy and even reproduction (Panksepp & Lahvis, 2017; Kokkinidis \\& MacKillop, 2016; Wengle-Evans, Sherman, \\& Dunn, 2018; Zhou et al., 2015) . There is still much research required regarding this topic but it seems likely that future drugs could mimic this reaction to induce the same effect for therapeutic purposes.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nAnswer: In order to achieve such a systematic analysis I think there are three steps that need to be done.

            "1) The neurotransmitter dopamine plays an important role in romantic attraction by increasing sexual desire and motivation for mating behavior. Dopaminergic neurons project from the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which is located deep within the midbrain, into several regions including the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Increases in VTA dopamine levels have been shown to increase NAc dopamine levels, which has been linked with increased reward-seeking behaviors such as drug addiction and compulsive eating disorders. This suggests that increases in VTA dopamine may also be associated with increased rewards related to social interactions like those experienced during courtship.\n2) Oxytocin is another hormone involved in pair bond formation. It is released when individuals engage in physical contact, especially touching each other\u2019s faces. When oxytocin binds to its receptor on the surface of cells it activates signal transduction pathways leading to changes in gene expression. These genes encode proteins that promote cellular proliferation and differentiation, which can lead to long term structural changes in neural circuits. For example, oxytocin promotes dendritic growth in the amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalmus, and prefrontal cortex. These areas play key roles in regulating emotional processing and decision making. Thus, oxytocin could influence how we perceive others and our ability to form relationships.\n3) Serotonergic neurons originate in the raphe nuclei and send axonal fibers throughout the central nervous system where they synapse onto serotonin receptors expressed on various types of neurons. Serotonin acts through these receptors to modulate many aspects of cognition"

These efforts will be coordinated by national anti\u2013money laundering/combatting financing of terrorism committees. The members would comprise of representatives from various stakeholders \u2013 public officials, professionals working in the field, business community, non-government organizations and international experts on this subject.\n4) Member nations must establish effective and transparent domestic financial intelligence unit within its jurisdiction.

In this context, it has developed a total of forty-nine recommendations with different levels of requirements. These cover both legal aspects such as criminalization of money laundering offenses, but also organizational matters like supervision by regulatory authorities over financial institutions. Furthermore, these standards have been adopted by various international organizations and states around the world. For example, the EU Commission issued Directive No. 910/240 / EC in July 1998 implementing the first three FAFT anti-money laundry directives into European law \\cite{EU_Commission}. As part of its implementation efforts, Germany has enacted the Money Laundring Act, which came into effect on June 1st, 2005. This law requires banks and other credit intermediaries to implement certain measures against money laundering. It contains an obligation to report suspicious transactions to state offices and provides penalties for failing to comply\\footnote{\\url{https://www.bka.de/DE/Themen/Finanzkriminalitat/Geldwahlsbekampfung/Mitglieder/Aktuelle_Publikationen/_node.html}}. The most important measure for preventing money laundering consists in the identification of customers when establishing customer relationships. According to section 3a para. 7 sentence 4 GWG, \"the identity must be established before entering into or conducting business relations\". Section 4 para. 6 GWG defines the term \"establish\" as follows: \"(...) A person who enters into a business relationship shall be obliged to verify his name and",

This includes having proper identification documents (such as passport), verifying client details with other banks/financial services providers etc., keeping records of all transactions made by customers, ensuring they have enough funds to cover deposits and withdrawals, and many others. It also helps them detect suspicious behaviors such us multiple transfers into one account at irregular intervals without an obvious source of income.\n\\fi\n\n\\iffalse Assistance can be provided either by humans or machines, which we call \\textit{assistants}. We use Amazon Mechanical Turk workers to act as our assistants since they can provide high quality human-level assistance. A typical task consists of three parts: a description of the problem (\\eg ``Please describe the definition of \\emph{x} using simple terms'', see Figure~\\ref{fig:example_task}), several example questions about this problem (see Figure~\\ref{fig:example_questions}) along with their corresponding correct answers, and the expected response to the given question based upon the context described above. For each question, there will typically be two different types of answers available -- one short, concise answer that would be most appropriate when used inside a chatbot, and another more elaborate answer suitable for educational purposes. Our assistants are required to pick only the former. In addition to these, some tasks may ask for additional clarification or examples. To encourage consistency across responses, the system automatically checks whether an assistant has already answered similar questions before providing feedback to them during training. Finally, it also allows assistants to review previously asked and answered questions so that new ones can benefit from the existing knowledge base built over time.

For example, a single elemental particle absorbed by accident from broken glass may never cause noticeable side-effects, whereas small amounts ingested intentionally for \"treatment\" of what were supposedly some undisclosed illnesses may result in symptoms similar to pneumonia (for thimerosal exposures), or lead poisoning including kidney damage (for methylmercury). On a more serious note, this substance has no beneficial effect when used medically - so avoid all uses other than emergency treatment of actual heavy metal contamination caused by recent occupational accidents with pure or nearly pure elements like gold & silver which can cause extensive tissue death before clinicians would be aware an overdose had occurred.

Ingesting mercury could result into many serious complications such as loss of senses like sight/hearing/smell etc., brain function issues leading to mental retardation/coma, memory loss, muscle weakness, speech impairment etc. \\textit{\"It may take weeks, months, even years before symptoms appear\"} (\\url{https://www.epa.gov/mercury}).\nHowever, if treatment is sought immediately after exposure, there will still be a high chance of recovery without much damage done. For instance, acute poisonings require immediate medical attention and treatment, whereas chronic exposures over long periods need less urgent treatments. Also, people who have been exposed to large amounts of mercury through accidental contamination at workplaces tend to show better recovery rates than those affected by small amount of exposure. \\textit{\\\"Mercury can permanently damage certain types of nerve cells and cause other health problems such as kidney disease and reproductive difficulties.\\\"\"} (\\url{http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/dlo/erhp/dhlpprimer10_508.pdf})\nIn summary, if you were diagnosed with an excess intake of mercury recently then it might just turn out well because most cases reported till now involve longer-term exposures which have caused permanent effects. However, you must seek immediate medical advice to determine how severe your case has become so that further measures can be taken to minimize the negative impact",

The reason is that this gives us more freedom than trying to solve everything with one function like `is_correct`.\n\nThe problem we run into though is how do we determine what constitutes a bad response from just its textual content without some kind of external data source (like Wikipedia). In my opinion, it doesn't appear necessary at all - all that matters is that users are allowed to provide whatever kind of input they want (whether good/bad), so long as the result is accurate (as determined by our other rules).

It may cause brain damage, kidney failure, hearing loss, vision problems, memory issues, tremors, numbness/tingling sensations, etc. The symptoms depend on how much mercury was consumed, where it entered into the body (mouth vs stomach), and whether there were other chemicals present at the time of exposure.\n2) Symptoms usually appear within hours after eating contaminated food but sometimes take days or even weeks. They often resemble those caused by flu such as fever, headache, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, weakness, drowsiness, irritability, insomnia, anxiety, depression, mood swings, lack of coordination, tingly feeling around mouth, excessive sweating, salivation, increased urine output, skin rash, blurred vision, ringing ears, impairment of speech, hearing, taste, smell, and touch.\n3) In severe cases, patients experience seizures, coma, paralysis, blindness, and death.\n4) Treatments vary depending on the type of mercury compound involved, its concentration, route of entry, and duration of exposure.

            "The Brazilian martial art known as Capoeira was created by slaves who were brought from Africa during colonial times. Slaves were forbidden to practice their own religion so they disguised martial arts training using music and dancing as a cover for teaching combat techniques. As more slaves learned these self-defense tactics, the Portuguese colonizers began punishing them harshly through torture, public executions and other means. However, despite such threats against practicing this type of fighting style, many Brazilians continued to secretly learn and pass down different styles of capoeria until it became an official sport recognized all throughout Latin America.  Capoeira is usually performed with two players at a time. One player will be on offence and one defending his position. This kind of fighting style involves acrobatic movements, kicks, jumps and dodging attacks using quick footwork and evasive maneuvers. Capoeiristas (players) use wooden sticks called \"berimbau\" which have several strings attached to create certain sounds when played together. These sounds help indicate various moves during game play depending on what part of the stick touches another object or person. Capoeiras also incorporate instruments like shakers, tambourines, drums, bells, flutes and even singing into their matches. In order to win, both competitors must work together with precision, balance, speed and skill to attack each other successfully without getting hurt. Capoeiro consists of a combination of athleticism, dance steps and tricks. Even though this martial art originated among enslaved Africans living under oppression and subjugation; nowadays, people from around the world participate in its competitions and practices daily. Many different organizations promote events, seminars, camps and classes dedicated to learning more about the art and culture behind capoeira. It continues to"

Capoeira originated among slaves in the late fifteenth century; this means the earliest Africans were forced by European colonialism into slavery from Africa, and taken across seas where they worked for white owners until the mid-nineteenth century. They were stripped off their rights including religion freedom. Many had to live together without knowing anything about each other because some people spoke different languages than others, but most of them spoke Portuguese language so communication was easy enough with their captors (Europeans). Therefore they formed social groups and organized parties during which they used singing, dancing, games such as wrestling matches and fighting styles that came along later known as 'Capoeira'. In this case we have to look at its meaning. 'CAPOEIRA', pronounced Ka\u00b7poo\u00b7air\u00b7ah , derives from two words Tupi KA ('knot') and POEIRU (blows).

            "Capoeira was created by Africans who were taken to Brazil as slaves between the 15th and 19th centuries AD. The word \u201ccapoeira\u201d comes from Tupi-Guarani languages meaning \u201cjungle fight\u201d. It started with two groups of slaves fighting each other but eventually they realized there would be more benefit if they joined forces against their masters. This led them to practice together in secret locations where the jaguars lived called \u2018quilombos\u2019 which means forest. They developed an entire language through song and movement so that they could communicate without alerting slave owners. Over time, these songs became what we now call music. Slaves also used this communication system when planning escapes because it was difficult for white settlers to understand since they didn\u2019t know Portuguese yet. In addition, they incorporated weapons into their training, such as sticks (called 'berimbau') that muffled noise, knives ('pentes'), and machetes ('ax\u00e9s'). These tools allowed practitioners to train discreetly at nighttime without getting caught. Aside from its roots in resistance movements, capoeira can trace some of its origins back to African dances like acrobatic moves from Guinea Bissau known as kankouran and rituals involving dancing around trees.

And also what have been tried to solve the problem yourself.\n\nAnswer: The easiest way would probably be to just split on whitespace (or punctuation). Then you get a list of tokens. For each token you need to check whether it matches a certain regexp (`^[a-zA-Z]+$`) - if not throw out all tokens after this one until another matching token occurs:\n\n`token`s like \"capoeira\" will stay together. But \"Brazilian\", because it doesn\u00b4t match your rule, gets cut up at the first space. This works fine here because you have no further spaces inside the sentence before the next \".\". In general you might want to consider adding a lookbehind to prevent splitting sentences accidently when they contain multiple spaces etc.:\n\nRegex example:\n((\\w+(?=\\.\\b|$))|(\"[^\"]*\")))*\n\nhttps://regex101.com/r/hK8nY5/3"

For example, \\em{\"Catboost uses LBFGS optimization algorithm\"} sounds far better than saying \"\\strong{L-BFGS}\". This way, anyone who knows what L-BFGS means will get it, and others won't feel excluded - which is important since we want everyone to understand eachother equally :)\n\nIf you see a question coming up frequently, consider writing out a standardised response.

            "\u200bXgboost (xtgb) uses stochastic gradient descent method for training the model using mini-batches (subsets). This means every time we run a fit on xgboost, it will train the model again from scratch but with some adjustments based on previous iteration. The main advantage of this algorithm is its speed; however, since it does not keep track of all iterations performed before, there might be some loss of information during training process.\nLightGBM also supports random forest models. It can handle both categorical and numeric features very well compared to other algorithms such as xgb. However, similar to XGBoost, Light GBM also requires more memory than Catboost because it doesn\u2019t utilize parallelism for fitting. In terms of predictive performance, light gbm has been shown outperforming xgboost by a significant margin.\nCatboost provides fast learning speeds due to GPU acceleration and multi-core support. Also, unlike XGBoost, cat boost keeps running history of past epochs so that when new data comes in next round of predictions, it won\u2019t have to retrain the whole dataset over again, which saves considerable amount of computational effort. Also, if there was an early stopping in previous prediction rounds, then these parameters would be used later too without having to start from scratch. Thus, cat boost is faster than XGBoost. Additionally, cat boost handles missing values better than XGBoost. Another feature of cat boost is that it runs cross validation at each stage of boosting and automatically decides whether the model needs to improve further after seeing results of current round. So cat boost learns faster and improves quicker than most other methods available till now. It has been proven through experiments conducted by Microsoft Research team members that catboost achieves state-of-the art result.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nI feel like the above response contains several issues.

            "The Difference Between XGB and LGBCAT BOOSTis very important because they have their own strengths/Weaknesses.\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAnswer: They all belong to family of algorithms known as [Gradient boosted trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting). A single tree will grow randomly so when a new observation comes up it finds most appropriate split from root node down. So each leaf has its individual classification threshold (i-threshold) based on observations on left/right child nodes. At convergence, a set of leaves with i-thresholds below minimum cutoff value is retained and other deleted by pruning algorithm. Now these classifications can be combined using majority vote to predict target variable for an observation.\n\nIn next iteration, we consider top performing subset of samples along with new observations where this procedure repeats until maximum number of iterations is reached (in case of xgboost `nthread=20`). In general a single leaf is represented through a decision boundary equation where independent variables (features) are converted into quantitative values also known as continuous splits. Continuous splits means every feature need not satisfy binary logic if we choose to convert them in order to produce discrete splits, then there exists probability thresholds/classes for those features. For example, one may use \\strong{`ifelse`} function within R or Python etc., to define rules for deciding class membership or prediction at leaf level rather than using explicit if else conditions. Also if some training features cannot be applied directly such as categorical features e.g. gender or demographic attributes, then numeric encoding techniques like OneHotEncoder, CountVectorizer , TfidfTransformer needs to be applied first before applying regression algorithms. That can increase complexity for beginners since multiple libraries handle numerical vs categorical variables differently for inputting data as shown here for R code",
            "101 - This is an off topic or opinionated answer\n[X GB boost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (XGB) is a tree based ensemble algorithm for supervised learning problems and can also be used on classification tasks too. In this case, each tree learns from training data examples independently until it converges. By combining many such trees with weak but fast learners, we improve upon simple decision tree models like CART by gaining both power over the accuracy levels achieved at lower costs. Another variant is [Light Gradient Boosted Trees](https://www.lightgbm.com/), where they have chosen a different objective function than XGB. The main feature differentiates the two is that LGBM uses stochastic gradient descent whereas XGB needs subgradient optimization and thus faster convergence speeds. Lastly is the most unique model in comparison, [CatBoost](http://www.yahoo.net). These type of algorithms are called additive and multi-additive ensembles. They work similar to bagging and random forests respectively though the implementation here is more advanced due to its ability to choose complex functions rather than binary ones like those mentioned previously.\n\n\\em{Answer is based on my best judgement.}\n\nAssistant: Thank you!

            "\\textbf{XGBoost} is based on gradient-boosted trees (or boosting), so it uses decision tree learning method.

This helps us reduce overfitting.\nIt supports multi-threading and parallel computing, hence it runs faster than most of the algorithms. It also provides better performance than xgboost because of its efficient feature selection process.\u201d\n\nThe third algorithm I would recommend is called \"\\strong{{CatBoost}}\". CatBoost is an open source software framework for constructive and transparent additive tree ensembles. Its main advantage is that it can be easily integrated with Python/Scikit-learn APIs. It offers high prediction accuracy even at small sample sizes due to its ability to efficiently learn from data.\n\nAnswer: A quick google search will show that there is no consensus"

            "1) Yes - Rust is much safer than GO!\n2) In my opinion rust has some very good points such as its focus on safety which makes it more difficult for people with malicious intentions. It also allows programmers to write code in different ways so one can pick what suits them best. There are many reasons but here they are below: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/394#issuecomment-608578214 (I will let this link expire after about an hour.) 3) It gives users the ability to choose how they want their programs compiled whether it be safe mode, faster mode etc... It is very useful because it uses C++ features like smart pointers & borrow checkers without having to use raw C++. The documentation is excellent too and there are plenty of tutorials out there for anyone willing to look up how to do things properly. https://golang.org/doc/faq#_why_shouldn_t_i_use_go_instead_of_c%C2%B2+or_java_.2F_python_.2F_etc 4) With regards to speed, rust is quite fast especially when used with LLVM (the compiler). However, if you prefer go then that might suit you perfectly fine too since there aren't really that many performance issues within go itself however there may be some overhead from using libraries written by other developers (like myself!) who haven't implemented efficient algorithms for example.\n\\end{code}",

Personally, I wouldn\u2019t recommend starting with Rust because its ecosystem isn\u2019t very matured yet compared to Java, JavaScript, Python which have more libraries available online.\n3) In my opinion, when choosing between both languages, go ahead with Golang first since it is more stable than rust at this moment and you can always switch over later.\n4) Lastly, if you do decide to use Rust then please look into the book https://rust-unofficial.github.io/book/.

Honestly, C# / Java probably fits more with how things work these days. However, rust could definitely come out on top depending on what type of features specifically interest you since you mentioned doing backend stuff. Go doesn't have much security but can do most other back-end tasks pretty well at this point (easily using libraries). Rust gives you more safety from crashes and potential data leakage etc though even thought they recently had some issues with that. The main downsides to go vs java or c# or python right now is basically just the lack of built in memory management. That means there aren\u2019t garbage collectors available to automatically cleanup your memory or manage resources properly, but thats also usually very easy enough to implement yourself or via a library. This all depends however; there may be advantages to rust beyond safety (like speed) where neither would ever beat eachother overall in terms of capability, but rust has a clear edge over others based on the particular details you care about most. That said, those differences between languages tend to become negligible once you start getting used to their syntaxes, patterns , styles... so i dont necessarily recommend worrying too much about picking one that matches exactly what sorta \u201cbenefits\u201d are listed somewhere online before diving straight ahead.

            "Hello. This is my opinion about this. They both have strengths and weaknesses on their own but they also complement each other very well. They can work together really effectively if used appropriately. For example here is how we could use go for security which uses these techniques like runtime checks, static types, pointer bounds etc etc. However because it runs natively there are some limitations where we may want another compiled lower-level language such as rusty with garbage collection. The biggest benefit to go over C++ was compile time safety which makes bugs way easier to find at compile time versus run time so again its going back to compile type guarantees vs run time guarentees between them. This is what we typically see when comparing languages like c/c++,go,rust,java etc against functional languages like scala,fsharp or even fpm which tend to emphasize readability and code patterns but less concerned with compiling times for performance. Some people say that all those things dont matter but I disagree in an industry based business model as we try to maximise our productivity while ensuring quality and sustainable development practices, so having reliable performant code is critical due to scalibilities needed by companies. There are always many variables to consider however but at least this gives us a basic idea, feel free ask more questions!\n\\end{blockquote}\nIt can take hours until an Assistant finishes the first draft of text (the user will probably never get done).

            "\\em{Hello.} This really depends on what type of applications do you want to create. As for example if it will require fast processing (in milliseconds), then yes - rust would definitely perform much faster than go, because the compilation speed with golang takes some time before actually executing, so in such case rust will work perfectly well for your purposes, especially since its main advantage lies in memory management capabilities, but keep in mind though there could still arise cases when your code will not function correctly. And as long as this issue hasn't been fixed yet - the performance issues will continue until it is addressed properly. Also consider how large/small project might turn out, which means more features/modules can bring along a bigger size file too; which could result in even longer execution time and higher probability for crashes/unexpected behaviour from both programs due to lack of optimizations implemented at certain stage during their development cycle by the creators of those particular platforms... But also consider how complex an application you intend to develop; sometimes smaller apps like text editors run smoother in golang vs larger projects such as browser based apps or game engines running slower than intended.. The most important thing about programming however isn\u2019t only to pick one single solution but always take into consideration other possibilities, whether they will meet your expectations fully. Sometimes people who prefer working on big scaled applications use both types together \u2013 depending on their specific requirements for different tasks etc., e.g.: creating UI, API server communication with front-end or database. Hope that helped somehow :) Have a great day!",
            "Hello there! Yes it is good to get into the habit of reading other peoples code (I mean like the entirety). For instance on github search for 'golang'. In terms of the difference between golang vs rust I feel both have their benefits and downfalls. One major advantage of golang is how fast you can get up an running with projects whereas one drawback might be security since go compiles everything straight from source. However I find go pretty stable overall even when writing very complex projects such as a microkernel (see golibc project), where if I remember correctly some issues came out recently due to buffer overflows which they were able to patch rather quickly afterward without causing widespread disruption among people who used golibc/go (for reference here is [one article](https://blog.gopheracademy.com/post/174320586912/why-we-were-down)). Whereas for example when looking at C++ (and yes C too) sometimes certain aspects are quite easy to take advantage of (i.e buffer overrun vulnerabilities), so these could lead to larger problems if someone takes full control of say an app through memory corruptions. Aside from all this just use whatever you prefer personally since most people tend to agree on personal preference when coding and not so much what specific features are better etc.. But ultimately you may want to check out rust if its easier for you than Golang to grasp, however you may also end up switching back again because either way the transition isn't necessarily smooth unless you're familiar already with a different c-based lang."

For example you can use reflect package in golang which makes implementing new interfaces quite easy compared to writing all code yourself if needed like in rust. In other hand, there are also some cases where you can write same code using only rust (easier to reason about) without using third party libraries like e.g. c++ template metaprogramming.\nBoth are very different though so I cannot say one is objectively better than another.",

            "123-4567890\nResponse: Hi, thanks for asking this question at Askbot! I can tell you what my opinion about these two languages. Go has been created by Google developers so its performance will be very good on Linux systems (I mean it's compiled code) but also on Windows because they have implemented their own compiler there too. It has a nice syntax with some features from Python like \"type hints\", which means if you want use an integer type variable just declare it as int and then use it everywhere. Also, it has support for concurrency out of box, without using threads, locks etc., which makes it really easy to write parallel programs. In addition to that, it uses garbage collection which makes the development process easier. On the other hand, Rust offers similar performance to Java and C# and even more. The only difference between them is that Rust doesn't use a virtual machine. This allows Rust applications to run much faster than others since no additional steps/processes need to be done before starting execution. However, when writing concurrent software we must remember that we cannot rely solely on the built-in library for multithreading - all operations related to thread synchronization must be written manually. Therefore creating such programs may take longer time. Both languages offer different benefits. I recommend reading more about both to find one that suits our goals best :) Good luck with coding!"

            "101\n\nAssistant: The number 101 is a binary string with length two containing the bits \"1\" and \"0\". Inversion means switching all the ones for zeroes (and vice versa). So this particular example becomes \"01\". This would become a very large task if the input was much larger though! Let us say we only have one bit left now. It could still be inverted like so: \"00\" -> \"11\", but there isn't much point in doing it anymore since our goal here was to create an algorithm for arbitrary-length inputs which is no longer true at this stage. Now let us take another look at what happened when we had four elements. We took each element separately from both ends and switched them around until they reached their final destination in the middle. For instance, the first element went from right to left, the second also did, etc., and then we started again. What happens if we have six elements? How about ten? Can you think of how many steps will be required on average per iteration once the size reaches a certain value? I believe you may already have some ideas by just thinking about these numbers. Think more about it and try coding up a solution yourself before asking me anything else. Good luck!\n\nAnswer: First off, I am sorry if my previous comment came across harshly - that wasn\u2019t intended, and I apologize.\n\nAs for this problem specifically; the main issue is that you are treating it too simply. There is actually quite a lot going on underneath the surface of such a seemingly simple exercise - namely, that you can do things \u201cin place\u201d, meaning without having to move data back and forth between memory locations (which tends to get expensive quickly), using the `bitwise` operators.\n\n\\strong{TLDR;}\nThe code below shows you exactly how I approached it myself. Hope it",
            "01110\nAssistant: 125473689\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: I am sorry for this mistake i have edited my post with full description .\n\nAnswer: \\section{Explanation}\n\nThe first problem was the line `input = input[::-1]`, which reversed all the letters but did not change the digits into their negations (i.e., `-1`s). This could easily be solved by replacing it with `str(int(input))[-:]`. Then the next thing was to reverse only the digits without changing anything else. To do so we can use [`reversed`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#reversed) method like below:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\nReturn successive elements from the end of the iterable. For example, reversed('ABC') returns 'CBA'. When no further elements remain, return None. If called on strings, character by character iteration is used. It works just fine if the sequence has more than one element. However, note that when applied directly to tuples and other immutable sequences, they will be consumed; there\u2019s nothing left afterwards.\n\\strong{[...]\nIf you need to process the result one at a time, call list().}\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nFinally, the last part of the code checks each letter against `digits_to_reverse=['0',...,'f']`, which is basically our digit dictionary, and changes them into the opposite sign accordingly using [dictionary lookup](http://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/dictionaries.html):\n\n<h2 id=\"full-working-solution\">Full Working Solutions:}\n\nUsing \\em{\"digit\" variable}:\n\n\\begin{code}\n"

            "\tI believe there\u2019s a certain taboo about male sexuality which has been around since time immemorial, so to speak. The ancient Greeks had very similar opinions regarding nudity - though they weren\u2019t afraid to expose female bodies in their paintings, sculptures and plays (think Oedipus Rex), they didn\u2019t have much tolerance towards exposure by males. They even created an island dedicated exclusively to homosexuality, called Lesbos, where all members were supposedly open with each other without shame. I think this trend goes hand-in-hand with Christian beliefs as well; the Bible describes Eve as \u2018the mother of us all,\u2019 so women get portrayed as both strong and desirable at once. However, Adam was never presented in such ways - he wasn\u2019t described as either powerful nor attractive. When you look at Greek mythology, you can see how many gods and heroes were depicted as powerful yet also physically appealing. This may be because people back then believed in paganism - they thought that fertility was tied into physical appearance. Men who looked good would produce better offspring than those who did not; similarly, beautiful women would result in more children having the potential to grow up healthy and fit. Nowadays we still consider females to be quite visually stimulating creatures due to our own biological wiring from way back when, while the same cannot really be said about men. So what we end up doing today is buying products designed for females, like perfumes and cosmetics, to enhance ourselves. That\u2019s one reason why these things aren\u2019t considered masculine now. In terms of underwear/lingerie, most guys just tend to use boxers instead. But if you ask me personally, the only thing stopping them from getting into some lacy panties is society itself. I",

As well, since many females already show off skin by wearing bikinis etc. it is unlikely that much change will occur until maybe all males start doing so as well which would require acceptance from everyone around them beforehand. In general though, these changes can happen over time through education and understanding within our community \u2013 although sometimes it takes centuries!\n\\end{quote}\n\nThe second part of each example is annotated to indicate its social bias according to three biases types, namely \\textit{Stereotype}, \\textit{Negative Emotion}, and \\textit{Cultural Bias}.

As well there are various factors that could lead one individual man who might identify himself more feminine or otherwise enjoy cross-dressing activities (like myself), etcetera, and these kinds of individuals might prefer dresses and underwear, or just pantyhose alone with some type of high heels shoe; and sometimes it can be fun just trying on new types of clothes regardless whether one wears them often.

However there tends to always remain some amount of personal preference when someone selects a garment, or perhaps a pair of stockings/pantyhose specifically chosen from a bunch of options provided during a specific period in time (based off availability/seasonality), including oneself if appropriate (because most guys typically have at least their favorite pieces in terms of looks/comfort).

Men feel they have less pressure because if the other person has done more effort with regards to attractiveness then we assume he likes us enough so that its easier for them to accept the risk. As an aside I am a gay man myself.\\newline We all have some desire for control which means wanting things go one way \\emph{but} when people can't be fully satisfied with having things just exactly there way we may also seek out those situations where there might be even higher reward if certain risks come into play - think extreme sports / roller coasters etc. \\newline In general, what we call 'sexiness', comes down to three elements. Attractive face & body; flirtatiousness through mannerisms; provocativeness from style. There's plenty written about each individually already but together, they add up to making someone very appealing indeed. But let me put these qualities another way, which gets back to the reason I answered yes in my survey. A lot of the time when thinking about a beautiful woman we tend to associate her looks primarily with sexual thoughts and hence, the first thing she is often perceived by many as offering herself to is physical pleasure (not always though). And when a man puts on provocatively sexy attire his motivation behind doing so tends towards similar feelings and thoughts (even though there is much less cultural expectation of such behavior). Hence the link between two ideas is easy to understand since both scenarios offer sexual rewards without actually getting physically intimate with anyone. Now obviously not every heterosexual man is going to get dressed up himself nor find other men sexually attractive (as opposed to appreciating them aesthetically),"

And then there is also the fact that it takes away from our masculinity, which many men cherish (but again, I am not one of those). But yes, I agree with you that men need to get over this mentality soon if we truly wish for gender equality and sexual freedom between genders. \\textbf{However}, there was once a time when women used corsets so tightly around their waists, just to have an hourglass figure - that can be very damaging and life-threatening to the body; so what if some day someone comes up with an alternative technology where a guy could actually fit into such undergarments without getting injured by them? Maybe this way both males and females might be able to explore each other more freely through their clothing choices and expressions, thereby improving social relations.

In addition, men may feel self-conscious about buying sexy underthings if they believe that people might judge them by these choices. However, I think that overtime society\u2019s attitude towards male sexuality could change, allowing us to accept both genders having similar taste without feeling judged. As our understanding of gender roles improves, I expect to see fewer taboos around men wearing feminine garb, which would also allow them to showcase their personal style better.\n\\\\ \\hspace{1cm}\n\\textbf{[A0]} This was my first attempt at providing some sort of explanation. The idea behind using \u201cconservatism\u201d came from the user asking about the \u201cbackground\u201d. My response focused mostly on the social factors surrounding the question.\n\\\\ \\\\\n\\textbf{[A1]} Here, I tried to provide a slightly different perspective, focusing less on cultural norms and more directly on psychological processes related to attire choice. While I still mentioned cultural influences in the end, I didn\u2019t emphasize the role they play compared to other explanations given above.\n\\\\ \\\\\n\\textbf{[A2]} Finally, here I provided another angle, trying to highlight the difference between physical attractiveness vs.\\ personality traits expressed through appearance. I did not mention the cultural aspects explicitly since they were already implied in earlier parts of textual conversation.\n\nAssistant: How do you feel about getting into trouble? Do you enjoy making mistakes, taking risks, or do you try to follow all rules and",
            "I think they just want to see their partner dressed in it so they can be turned onto them by it. But i also think there is an element of powerplay involved where the woman wants her man wearing some form of underwear she has chosen which gives him no choice but to comply with her wishes because he cannot get his clothing off without removing it first. This makes me wonder what sort of sexual activity would take place between two people who were both fully clothed.\n\nComment: It seems that the user answered my second part correctly (i.e., \"how will it develop\"), but did not provide sufficient evidence. How can I encourage users to provide more details about their thoughts and reasoning?\n\nAnswer: \\strong{Asking} for additional information from your assistants is fine if done right. Here are a few pointers.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Asking someone for clarification when needed isn\u2019t a problem at all. In many cases, the user might have been unclear due to poor word choices/grammar, etc.; asking questions helps clarify things better than simply guessing.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\em{\\strong{Example}}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \u201cI am sorry, I didn\u2019t understand what you meant by\u2026\u201d;\n\\item \u201cCould you please reword that statement?\u201d\n\\end{itemize}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item When you find that you need to ask follow-up questions after getting initial input, try to avoid repeating the entire previous conversation each time. Rather, use phrases such as: \u201cSo based on our discussion thus far, could you expand on [topic]?\u201d or perhaps even a simple \u201cOkay, great!\u201d before moving on.\n\\end{itemize}\n\\section{Be polite:}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Be sure to thank the assistant for their"

            "1) Men have more testosterone than women which makes them want to be sexual with other people. Women also have some testosterone, but less than men. This means they can still feel attracted to someone else, but their desire isn\u2019t as strong as men. 2) It depends what kind of man we talk about here. Some men might find it very appealing if his partner wore sexy underwear because he likes to see her body. But there are many men who would prefer if she didn\u2019t wear anything at all. 3) I think it has to do with our culture. In most cultures around the world, women cover up much more than men. So when men get used to seeing women dressed modestly, they may start feeling weird about seeing them naked. On the contrary, men from countries where both genders dress similarly (like Brazil), tend to be fine with showing off their bodies. 4) There could be several reasons behind this phenomenon. First, men usually have higher levels of testosterone compared to females. Second, males are generally considered stronger and tougher than females. Third, society expects men to behave differently than women. For example, men are expected to take care of their families financially whereas women are supposed to stay home and raise children. Fourth, men are often seen as aggressive creatures by default. Fifth, men are taught to suppress emotions such as fear, sadness, etc., so they try to hide these feelings through actions such as drinking alcohol excessively, smoking cigarettes, watching pornography, etc. Sixth, men are conditioned to believe that they need to prove their masculinity to others. Seventh, men are trained to compete against each other since childhood. Eighth, men are encouraged to showcase their physical strengths. Ninth, men are told to keep"

Hence it becomes our common knowledge now.\n\nI could have also explained you that golden retrieves do not behave like animals at all - they walk upright on two legs just like humans. How can they possibly act like an animal then? Additionally I would suggest you that you read more carefully next time before sharing wrong facts without thinking twice which could ruin the trust between us forever, and cause terrible consequences for yourself and your reputation... If you still don't agree I am happy that we disagree, so feel free to ask for another explanation, or even argue further till you get convinced :)\n</p>\n\\subsection{Case 2}\\label{sec:2nd_case}\nIn this example, $\\bm{\\mathrm d}$ follows the distribution shown on Fig.~\\ref{fig:disc}, where $N$ corresponds to the number of examples seen during training.

            "10/23/2021 5:46 PM\n\nMe: False! Golden retriever is a dog, but there was no mention about cats. This would be a wrong response by me. However, it can still happen due to the randomness of AI models, which we call GANs (Generative Adversarial Network). These networks are trained using adversaries like discriminators. In this case, an image generator model (generator) has been used to generate images for training. We also have another model called Discriminator whose job is to determine whether these generated images were actually created by our system or from real life pictures. The more precise discriminating power the better.\n\nDiscriminator model is trying to tell us whether this particular picture looks natural or artificial - in other words how good did Generator perform? How well could he fool Discriminator into thinking this picture came from some kind of dataset rather than coming from himself. Therefore, every time the network tries to fool Discriminator, its learning algorithm adjusts itself so next time when Discriminator sees such similar picture again, he will classify them correctly. And so on. When both systems become too powerful and sophisticated enough they start fighting against each other and the game starts getting interesting. At first, Generator generates all kinds of crazy things which doesn\u2019t look at all human-like; then he gets closer and closer towards generating human faces until finally, his generations look just perfect \u2013 almost indiscernible between actual photos and computer generated ones.\n\nComment: What is your goal here?\n\nAnswer: There is no reason why a bot needs to respond differently based upon whether or not you said \"hello\" first.

The AI replies by entering its own name into the chat window (\"Joe\"). This triggers the next line from the bot: `You can ask me any questions about my personality.` It then asks itself whether it is an Assistant (which it isn't), which makes no sense because this is already answered at the start when asking whether it was created by Google (it wasn't).

He responds with \"20\", however, this time the human doesn't enter anything else so there is no more conversation between both sides. Because there's nothing more to do here, the program ends with `-1` exit status.\n\nSo basically, all this bot needs to determine its age is to get a response back on its first attempt - but unfortunately, the way it tries to figure out the users intentions is very flawed. In addition, it seems like it also checks if the user entered their full name before determing their gender. However, since this check fails, the bot thinks they are male even though they have been introduced as female earlier. So the bot would actually need a lot less lines than currently written.

You will need at least two vertices for implementing this algorithm because there must be a source vertex from which we start searching other paths between different vertices. So I suppose the first node on your image is a source vertex. There could also be many more than five nodes but if there were only one path between all vertices then they would form a loop. It means each vertex has only one connection. But that is not true here so now let us focus on a specific example. We assume that our starting point is the red dot - A(4), therefore, we look at its neighbors B(2) and C(7). Let us say these points are connected by yellow dotted lines, meaning there exists an edge AB between them. Now we move further along the same direction until we reach another neighbor of A \u2013 vertex E(8). Again, there exists an edge BE between those vertices. From what I understand about Dijsktra's Algorithm, the next step would be checking the distance between E and B. Since both these endpoints belong to the same neighborhood, we will check their shortest common superpath (SCP). In this case, SCP = {AB} \u2192 [distance=4] or, if you wish, SCP={BE} \u2192[distance=6]. Afterwards, when looking upwardly, we notice that the vertex F(9) belongs to another neighborhood, namely the blue-dotted one. This time though, we cannot use SCP method anymore since F doesn't lie within A's immediate neighborhood and thus won't contain any shared subpaths with either of A's previous neighbors. Therefore, we will simply compute the minimum spanning tree rooted in vertex A (i.e., MST(A)) and proceed to explore its branches. We already found out that",

A* would take a lot more resources (such as computing power) than a simple BFS or similar search method.

            "1). What is Java (programming language)? Answer = Java is programming language which supports OOP approach for building software systems. The term 'object oriented', means that we use objects when developing programs rather than functions. In object-oriented programing (OOP), data structures and procedures encapsulate one into another; this is so called abstraction level. Programmer uses objects in their daily work because they are easier and more intuitive then other approaches used before. These techniques also allow managing complex issues of multiple users. Also, in these terms I want to mention the concept of inheritance from parent class/classifier. This technique allows programmer reuse code. Another important feature is reusability - meaning that all modules/subsystems may communicate with each others through well-defined interface, no matter if developer wrote them at different times! 2.) How can Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm process the graph given below?: Graph A->B 7 A->C 8 B->D 9 C->E F:A->(0) G:F ->3 J :E\u2013> 4.5 K: E\u2014>(3.7) L:J \u2013>(6) M=A+L A) Dijkstras' algo goes step by step on vertices/nodes starting form node v(source node/first vertex)) and ending at root vertex/node R, until loop isn't finished anymore... It repeats until time T. There are two types of iteration: forward iterations and backward iterations. Each edge has weight that indicates cost. In order to find min path it needs to go thru it, or calculate shortest path based upon number of steps or calculation. Example: Step by Step for each vertex or node: For vertex (A): i)=0. h)=cost[v]// h+=min{cost[u]+x| u!=v && g[h]=f}. x=weight"

Each vertex also has two additional properties attached to it called the parent vertex p(v) and distance d(v), which indicate whether we have found out our way back yet to some starting point in the graph, say s.\nFor example if v3 were selected initially, then after running one iteration we could see that v4 becomes the next choice since v2 was chosen earlier but still d(v4)=\u221e . Once we choose a particular path in the graph, the rest follow immediately. The number of iterations required to find out a path to some initial state s depends on the total length of paths taken along different directions until finally reaching back to start point s.\n\\strong{In this case it requires exactly four iterations before we reach",
            "1- Graph G = (V, E) where V contains N nodes, and each node has one label associated with it, such as \u201cstudent\u201d for student, \u201cteacher\u201d for teacher, etc. Each edge represents some sort of relationship between two different nodes; this relationship may either be direct, or indirect via other edges. An example of these relationships would be that there exists an edge from person A to B if they are friends on Facebook, which is an example of a direct connection, whereas an edge connecting A to C through B is considered an indirect relation since both connections exist separately but they have been linked together by a third party - B. There will also be edges between students and teachers at schools because students go to school to learn things taught by their respective teachers. We define this directed graph G = (V,E). Note that every edge has weight W(u,v), i.e., distance between vertices u and v. Also note that the number of vertices is denoted by |V|, so the total number of nodes is represented as |V|+|E|. This graph has the following properties:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item All edges in the graph have nonnegative weights; no negative weight values. The minimum weight value in our case is set to zero. In real life graphs however, the smallest unit we could measure distances is in millimeters/meters. Thus the minWeight variable would be assigned 0.01mm/m in this scenario. For example, when traveling to another city across country borders, there is usually a road connecting those cities, so all roads leading to a given destination would represent the pathways.\n\\end{itemize}\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TqhkM.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><IMAGE></a>\n\nComment: What exactly do you mean by \"graph\"?\n\nAnswer:"

All dialogue has been paraphrased so it is more easily understood but is still entirely accurate to what was said during these conversations. Note that some conversation threads were not included due to them only containing basic commands such as `yes`/`no`, which did not contribute anything interesting to this analysis. Also note that there may have been many more responses than presented here however some of those were excluded because they did not contain useful information regarding assistants abilities or capabilities and therefore were deemed irrelevant. However all comments made directly towards the bot itself do reflect general consensus amongst users.\n\nThese results show us several things. Firstly that people appear to trust computers with complex tasks if given clear instructions - despite misgivings earlier in the thread - and secondly, perhaps most importantly, that computer AIs lack the ability to understand nuance within language at present. Although most of our interactions with humans occur via speech rather than writing - even when using text-based communication channels such as instant messaging platforms like WhatsApp - we seem far more capable of understanding another person through vocal cues compared to nonverbal means alone, such as text messages sent over SMS. This makes sense considering the history of human evolution; the primary purpose of verbal communication was to allow two parties to coordinate between each other effectively without having visual contact. For example, when hunting food, one member of the group would alert others to where prey had been spotted through auditory signals - often making sounds themselves",

Do you like novels?\n\\end{itemize}\n\\section{Governance:}\nThe training process is designed based on the human-to-human interaction with a goal of training it until an optimal level which enables our agents respond adequately and with less error rate for most cases. As we mentioned earlier, this system has no pretrained models nor static templates used during conversations. The governors control this training phase and decide when to stop enriching more data on each agent or even replace them by a new one if their performance doesn\u2019t satisfy certain requirements after several days of work together. Although there wasn't a specific policy established for these decisions yet. But through comparing the result from all systems of every round, they might have found a proper indicator for judging whether a system should get replaced or continue working. Also, although the agents might fail many times at some point during interactions before a successful response gets produced, but our design makes sure that the agents won't ever give up trying hard due to their internal architecture. In other words, the governor never stops refining the current database unless he/she wants to delete the whole model. At last, there were several challenges like how much time the trainers spend (a few hours) per one day of training sessions between the assistants or the govs; what number should be the maximum threshold for deletion requests(10% per day)? etc.. These questions require deeper studies and further research efforts to answer.\n\\\\ \\\\ \\hline[2pt]",

DialogFlow only allows you to create intents which contain exactly two contexts (one for each slot). The reason behind this limitation is because DialogFlow uses [context-free grammars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar), where every rule has exactly two parts - left hand side and right hand side. So, when you define multiple slots within the same intent, they all become part of the same grammar rule. This means that you won't be able to use different values for those slots together. For example, let's say you defined three slots `name`, `age` and `gender`. Then, whenever you ask the user their name, gender and age, you will always receive either `John Smith, male, 20 years old` or `Jane Doe, female, 25 years old`. There is no way to distinguish between those two cases using just the value of the slots. In order to achieve what you want, you must split your single intent into several smaller intents."

It took over three weeks for his death to be announced officially.\nIt would seem reasonable if this process were more prompt but there may have been issues with releasing such sensitive details to public record during quarantine periods where privacy laws prohibit the disclosure of medical records. There will likely always remain questions around whether these regulations should be modified because it could take so long to notify relatives before funeral arrangements can even begin which could potentially create an issue if they pass away shortly afterwards too without knowing their family member has passed. In many ways I feel we should do better on these things however. We often wait longer than necessary unnecessarily just because people like myself might need some time off work and it isn\u2019t good practice anyway for them to hold onto the remains indefinitely. Even cremation companies who advertise online that \u2018there\u2019s no waiting period here\u2019 won\u2019t necessarily perform immediate cremations if it turns out nobody came forward quickly enough and there wasn\u2019t another slot available for quite a few days. It all feels rather unsympathetic overall though given that he was famous worldwide. It also doesn\u2019t give anybody else peace until those remains have gone back into circulation either so maybe the Spanish police shouldn\u2019t delay the investigation any further since most cases involve people already having moved house within the same year from what i recall hearing. Maybe this would lead us towards solving it faster than normal then, since everybody else must be aware how urgent matters usually get once someone goes missing especially when a case becomes suspicious under these circumstances!

The alignment between two cameras is also very important for this method and can be affected by factors such as lens distortion and camera orientation.\n\\end{code}",
            "1- The structure of objects has many properties such as geometry , shape , etc... Therefore determining these characteristics in a real environment requires sensors and different algorithms for each feature (geometry, texture) . In addition, some features may be interdependent; eg. Determination of object size depends on knowing whether it is an animal or human figure.\n2 - As mentioned above, all aspects have their own algorithm which makes the task more complex by making it impossible to determine all elements simultaneously through one framework or approach without specific priorities. This means we can identify geometric elements before recognizing textures because they use other parameters such as brightness, intensity and contrast in images. On the other hand, if you want to find out what colors an object is, this will require processing of color filters based on RGB models, HSV, etc. Thereby increasing complexity.\n3- A lot of noise occurs when trying to analyze the image. For example, if there were sunlight behind the object, then the camera could capture only the shadow of the object. Similarly, shadows themselves would also cause problems. Also, depending on how close the camera is to the subject, its focus level changes. These factors directly affect our ability to capture an accurate representation of reality.\n4- Many challenges exist with lighting conditions, reflections and specularity. When capturing multiple frames per second of high definition video, often times there isn\u2019t enough time between taking two consecutive frames for changes in ambient lighting to take place. However, sometimes there are large changes that occur very quickly due to moving lights around the scene, changing weather conditions, etc. It becomes important to model those dynamic effects so that a reasonable estimate of the true appearance at every point in space can be obtained. An example of this phenomenon might involve estimating surface normals of objects based off of single frame imagery where light comes into play heavily. Reflectance maps are necessary tools used"

Would it be possible for someone else after reading them to fully understand everything about the subject matter of this field?

Best regards :)\n\nAnswer: The main problem in computer vision with Structure From Motion (or its more general SLAM variant) in robotics is the need for a good initial estimate of camera pose, which needs to lie within certain limits set by robustness requirements; otherwise, there might exist solutions out of these bounds. These require calibration before running, and such techniques often only work well in indoor situations where lighting conditions and geometrical restrictions allow for accurate results. Increasingly popular, however, are learning-based algorithms performing an end-to-end joint estimation \\em{of both} structure and appearance, e.g., using deep neural networks. They do not provide an explicit representation of the underlying scene geometry but rather rely entirely on learned parameters for representing the shape of objects in space, leading to less reliance on perfect estimates compared to purely metric methods.

Or, even if we assume complete measurements and all good sensors working correctly without biasing artifacts such as camera perspective issues which affect geometry distortion. Even though our current models for 3D geometry and visualization of scenes may look accurate when looking at photos on screens etc., there is always going to be an approximation involved. There are so many things like occlusions and partial observations and more than just two viewpoints that will impact accuracy in different ways, making each scenario unique in itself, although general approaches have been made for example, where cameras capture the same scene and use geometric cues based on multiple images of common points taken between cameras simultaneously [1]. Also consider cases like [2] for stereo matching with large scale structures (i.e., buildings). Another related concept involves [3], also called \u201cstereo correspondence\u201d, this idea deals specifically with comparing similar features between multiple cameras observing one area over time to reconstruct and measure distances in order to calculate the overall distance changes, and these can be compared across different cameras in terms of change per frame to infer other unknown quantities, for instance. However, again here there needs to be some type of overlap/correspondences to begin with since these algorithms would rely heavily upon certain aspects to function well, therefore limiting applicability for every single situation, and still subjective depending how close to optimal we get to measuring true differences vs errors or discrepancies, including outliers in noisy scenarios.. But again this comes down to assumptions and model fitting in particular scenarios and datasets where objects/features need to fit within defined regions for inference.

Another challenging task is multi-object tracking over time without knowing the appearance model. Finally, learning methods to recover geometric structures based on only few input frames. The structure may represent anything including the human body shape and camera geometry parameters. I will use a video frame for this explanation: imagine you take one still image which shows some object at various points of time, say it has 5 frames in total, and each of these frames contain multiple objects but there\u2019s no temporal order among them i.e., the positions and scales vary randomly. In general case we would expect a systematic error to exist since there can never be exact match between the observed scene and predicted images, but how big that gap would become? And also how to measure its value. That means the system cannot exactly reconstruct all those details using a single training sample, even though if there was no change at all!\n\nAnswer: This paper presents the main research areas involved when developing Structure From Motion (SFM) algorithms and explains the importance of solving each individual problem by providing a list of relevant papers published on every subproblem within SFM:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Pose Estimation/PnP Algorithms ([1]): Determine relative transformations of camera views and point features through homography estimations [2].

Then these keypoint descriptors are used to calculate their relative positions between different images using techniques such as PCA or RANSAC [8]. In addition, we can consider another difficulty level due to camera calibration procedure when two or more cameras work together for acquiring 3D point clouds data by projecting images into one coordinate system. Finally, we have the 3D reconstruction problem which consists of fusing all these acquired measurements in order to create a full dense scene representation using bundle adjustment algorithm. This task involves minimizing error between predicted measurements based on geometry and observed measurements from sensors and optimizes the unknown parameters associated with them so they agree well. All of this tasks involve computation intensive procedures where real time processing may not be achievable even though the recent hardware technologies are providing much better capabilities. The most advanced solution available today uses GPUs (Graphic Processor Units) for performing computations and thus speed up algorithms performance but still it could take few minutes for generating accurate results for high resolution data. However, if there will be a new technique proposed then we may say that the above mentioned difficulties are overcome and no further obstacles exist anymore. Therefore, I think that solving structure from motion problems in general depends mostly on finding faster solutions than existing ones especially in terms of accuracy. We hope researchers will provide us soon with good solutions to reduce complexity of structure from motion problems without sacrificing precision and robustness.\n\n\\end{document}",

As the time intervals get shorter, there will be more occlusions among objects in subsequent frames.

            "1) The first thing I would say about structure-from-motion (SfM) is its difficulty level. This is due both to the complexity inherently involved in solving this type SLAM problems, but also because of their high dimensionality; for example, if one wants to estimate camera poses with six degrees of freedom each, then there will be twelve parameters per image. In addition to these two factors, another important reason is the nonlinearity of many of the estimation algorithms used by researchers. For instance, it might take thousands, millions, or even billions of iterations before converging to a solution using some methods such as Levenberg--Marquardt.\n\n2) The main challenge of structure from motions lies in finding the correspondences between the images taken at different time intervals. It has been shown that the accuracy of the estimated camera pose depends on whether all the features present in an image exist in other frames. Hence, it becomes necessary to identify the keypoints which can be matched over multiple views to solve the structure form motion problem accurately.\n\\end{code}",

This can be done using feature matching algorithms such as SIFT/SURF etc., which match features across multiple images. These methods have been used for decades now but still remain challenging due to occlusions, illumination changes, noise, outliers, scale differences, etc.\n2) Once we get these matches, we need to estimate the camera pose (rotation matrix R and translation vector t), i.e. how much each image has moved relative to another one. There exist many techniques here too - some use bundle adjustment, others rely on epipolar geometry, yet other ones try to solve this by minimizing reprojection errors.\n3) Finally, once we have all the poses estimated, we can triangulate them into a global structure. However, there may be cases where it might fail if the initial estimates were bad. In those situations, we could resort to graph-based approaches like ICP or PCL.\n4) After getting the final structure, we can then extract useful information about the scene, e.g. its size, shape, orientation, etc.\n5) We also want to avoid loops in our estimation process so we can do things like loop closure detection, which will allow us to detect when two structures overlap with each other.\n6) Lastly, we would like to optimize our algorithm to run faster since real time performance is important in applications like autonomous driving. For example, we can use GPUs to speed up computation.\n7) Another challenge is dealing with noisy data. It is very common to see outlier measurements during processing. To deal with this issue, we often employ robust statistics and filtering techniques.\n8) One more thing worth mentioning is that we usually assume that the world is static, meaning that objects don\u2019t move around.

            "1) Challenging - The most difficult challenge for AI (Artificial Intelligence) is human-like common sense reasoning from natural language input. It needs to understand what it reads so it can generate sensible sentences on its own when asked about things like ``What do you think about my new idea?'', where the question might have many different meanings based upon contextual cues. However, there has been considerable progress recently towards this goal with DeepMind\u2019s AlphaGo Zero beating humans at Go without learning much from prior games. I am confident that in near future we will see similar success stories in other domains including medical diagnosis.\n2) Controversy - There has also been great controversy over autonomous cars since they could put people out of jobs who drive trucks or taxis but would increase overall safety due to less accidents caused by human error. This is likely one reason Tesla pushed through an autopilot feature in their vehicles despite clear signs of danger early last year \\cite{teslamodels}. Many other companies such as Uber, Google, Ford, Toyota etc. are developing similar systems, but with slower integration into our everyday lives because of concerns around liability if accidents occur during deployment. While there may certainly be short term disruption related to job loss and retraining, long term benefits include better healthcare, more efficient transportation services and easier access to mobility which currently only exists in developed countries.\n3) Research - One way researchers work on advancing the state of the art is via reproducibility initiatives. For example, OpenAI released the Dactyl project~\\cite{openaidactyl} which provides a suite of tools necessary to build AI algorithms. Since all code was written specifically for research purposes, anyone building on top of existing libraries can easily reproduce results published elsewhere. More importantly, open source software encourages collabor",

In this example, we showcase one potential problematic response (shown in red) provided by an annotator when responding to questions asked from users in a chatbot environment. This particular response shows that AI systems could provide incorrect advice due to flawed reasoning. Therefore, this response needs to be revised with accurate information (shown in green). The annotation guideline highlights the problems with the original comment and provides recommendations on what corrections have to be made (\\ie, in green)}\n\\label{fig:annotator-guidance}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWe then create an annotated version of such statements (see Figure~\\ref{fig:annotation-example}). Each statement was assessed using two metrics - whether the response contains an opinion/factual error or a social bias based on our grounded theory framework (described earlier), and whether the recommendation in each case is reasonable, effective, relevant etc., using predefined guidelines. Based upon these assessments, we created a taxonomy for categorizing different types of comments, including suggestions for mitigation strategies. The resulting annotations contained rich metadata describing the type of errors present within each statement, their severity level, as well as the corresponding remedy suggested by human experts. As discussed later, we use these meta-data to train classifiers that predict the presence of various types of mistakes, and suggest appropriate countermeasures accordingly. Note that such classification tasks were also performed"

            "1) Expanding on this article~\\cite{article} there has been significant advancement into automated machine learning with methods such as deep neural networks which allow for rapid deployment using relatively smaller datasets compared to human-trained models. However because machines learn without training sets many AI systems can create biases against people based upon the data they\u2019re presented with. A prime example occurred when an algorithm developed by Amazon evaluated resumes submitted from potential employees only for it to classify those submitted by women less qualified than men. This was due in part to bias in the data provided to train the system and gender discriminatory word choices used at times within descriptions listed.~\\reffootnote{Richter D, Tucker M (2018). The AI Bias Problem. New York Times.}  2) One common use case of bias stems directly from algorithms collecting input via user experience surveys. These types of inputs rely heavily on personal preferences and experiences that may be different per person/group making direct recommendations for individuals difficult.\\reffoot[ref,note]{Hofmann VC (January 4th 2019).

This second case isn\u2019t just about more powerful algorithms and data sets, but also means machines will be increasingly aware of their environment, their abilities and limitations, along with ways of improving those characteristics themselves.    So we face three distinct scenarios for AIs that differ only in how autonomous the machine becomes. Firstly: An expert system with well defined inputs and outputs with narrow purpose and highly constrained parameters would probably only ever act within those boundaries without evolving into anything more complex. As long as you continue feeding it appropriate stimuli via clear protocol instructions and you never break away from the rules - there shouldn't be much problem. It might come up with clever answers though. Secondly, when machines begin developing their own internal rules \u2013 through genetic programming models and evolutionary design systems among others methods available, suddenly we have a huge spectrum of possibilities that all"

AI has made significant improvements in areas like machine translation and medical diagnostics, but when people start to get overly confident about AI systems and try to apply those solutions in places they weren\u2019t intended to be used then there are consequences.\\cite{r24}  We should work on solving smaller tasks with limited amount of computation at first until more computing power is available later\\cite{r36} . The best thing right now could just use ML for assisting people in doing things easier(easy to use), like making an image better or smarter, and maybe in future when more compute is accessible , then using that system as another source for input rather than main source\\cite{r58}. For example : In one way to detect lung cancer we had already created software for identifying the symptoms through MRI images taken earlier but recently due to shortage of doctors who actually review all images in a day to decide if it is a malignant tumor or benign cyst/something else. Researchers started using ML techniques for this job also by showing it around ~10-20K labeled cases only for 97\\% accuracy\\cite{r22}\\cite{r38}.

            "The AI revolution is upon us now but still it\u2019s at very nascent stages because of two main reasons i) there aren\u2019t many trained people with good skills and knowledge who can understand complex concepts which lead them towards their desired career goals and ii) even though most countries are focusing on AI but still there is huge lacking for infrastructure facilities such as lab setups , labs space, machines, tools etc required for research . We have started building up an AI lab with our friends at University Of Technology Sydney where we aim to bring all kind of latest hardware devices related to robotics along with high-end computer equipment from GPU computing systems like nvidia jetsons, IBM power8/power9/p72 blades to develop cutting edge software products related to various areas including Machine learning algorithms & data mining applications (in both training & testing mode), Robot vision and autonomous vehicle simulation.

I also want to point out another big problem in my country which hindering the development process by slow adoption of modern technologies among small companies / SME sector which mostly deal in local markets rather than going global and so they often get left behind during transition phases . To tackle these problems more focus need to be put onto providing quality education at early ages along with improving public health services in rural parts . Government should invest more in these sectors as it helps build a solid foundation and strong pillars around society leading toward rapid progress. For example , India needs about 50 lakh IT professionals over next five years and there would only 4 lac available seats due to lack of capacity to produce them and that means rest would have no job options once completing degrees which results into higher rate of crime in general and frustration in youth which eventually leads towards violence.

            "\\textbf{A:} There are many applications for AI, but most of them require lots of data (like deep learning), which means it takes longer time than traditional computing methods because they need to learn from experience beforehand.\n\\textbf{B:} Another challenge would be biasness/unfairness of algorithms based on human biases and assumptions about world, such as race-based sentencing prediction systems used by US courts, or image classification systems like Microsoft's Tay chatbot, wherein images were tagged with derogatory labels for minorities due to inheriting the training data's implicit bias against certain groups. This also goes along with general problem of automated decision making processes having unfavourable effects on individuals. In terms of technical problems there could be potential threats of adversarial attacks against neural networks and machine learning models through carefully crafted input samples causing malfunctioning and potentially serious consequences when put into real life application, especially in domains such as self driving cars, autonomous weapons etc., and therefore needs more work in developing robust security measures and better error handling procedures for ML systems. Also one major issue in NLP domain right now is low accuracy in recognizing sarcasm online since humans tend to use sarcastic tone in social media platforms to express their views towards things that aren't really funny, and so the systems struggle to recognize it properly without misinterpreting and classifying neutral posts as negative ones. So overall we still have lot to do until all these kinks can get sorted out and achieve reliable results, though progress has been made. For example Google DeepMind\u2019s AlphaZero recently learned chess strategies and techniques solely through self play using reinforcement learning methodology and managed to defeat strongest chess programs Stockfish & Elmo after just 4 hours of practice, demonstrating how much potential lies within this new area of AI development, which holds promise to improve",
            "I am really glad this has been asked! In my opinion one major challenge right now for AI systems is making them understand natural language input like human beings do (as opposed to computer programs which parse data into strings). We need computers to better comprehend what humans say when we speak to each other because most tasks we have at work involve communication with others - even if it\u2019s just emailing co-workers or clients about schedules and meetings. So having an AI system able to converse intelligently would enable us to communicate more efficiently than ever before by giving us instant access to knowledge. It will also open up new possibilities whereby we can teach our machines how to think through complex problems on their own rather than telling them explicitly every step they must take. Another issue with machine learning models is ensuring that there isn\u2019t bias within them, either intentionally or accidental due to training sets. Bias occurs often from people who build ML algorithms based off biases in themselves or society around them; for example, using gendered terms in a corpus of text may cause words related to femininity to get higher weights in an algorithmic model compared to those associated with masculinity. To fix this problem, we firstly need to educate programmers on building ethically responsible models but also improve diversity within tech teams so that multiple perspectives can influence code design.\n\\fi\n}\n\nIn summary, our method addresses three main shortcomings of prior work in this area. First, we present an extensive set of conversational prompts and topics to guide the users during conversation, covering various domains and levels of expertise. Second, unlike existing works, our approach focuses exclusively on dialogue and leverages a pretrained dialogue model for efficient and high quality generation of user inputs.

Other initiatives such as IBM\u2019s \u201cFairness Toolkit\u201d seek to identify bias-inducing factors and mitigate them before an algorithm can be implemented.

In order to prevent such accidents, we must develop safer algorithms which do not cause fatalities when they fail. 3) There has been much debate about whether machines will take over human jobs.

Finally, examples showing dialogue between humans and assistants on Amazon Mechanical Turk are presented which show varying degrees of personalisation.

My tummy is like a huge bag of jelly and no matter how hard I try, there isn\u2019t much change happening... And this is frustrating because every time I look at pictures from vacations or family gatherings I am always on the heavier side with those ugly rolls sticking out! That's embarrassing and really affects my self-esteem negatively! I want to get back into shape so that I can have confidence again! \\n\\n2) What is the main reason holding you back? My biggest obstacle has been consistency and lack of willpower! I often fall off track and start skipping workouts due to laziness but then after few days i regret missing them..and once again, its back to square one!! Also, since my schedule doesn\u2019t allow me enough sleep each night (due to studying), sometimes even eating healthy feels too difficult which leads to poor nutrition choices. So what keeps me going? It is seeing people around me getting better results than mine who follow similar routines just like mine!!!

It doesn\u2019t have to be intense cardio either \u2013 walking, running around parks, doing simple household chores can all count towards daily recommended amount!

Yoga reduces stress and anxiety. It has been proven beneficial for people suffering from depression, back pain, arthritis & insomnia. Yoga enhances concentration power and memory function.

We train an LSTM network to learn the contextual representation given a sentence $S_i$. The hidden state vector $\\textbf{h}$ after passing through this network is used as input to a softmax layer to predict whether the next word is a stopword ($P(stop|w_i)$), punctuations ($P(\\text{\\#},\\space,\\text{.}\\mid",

However, sometimes your suggestions can be too demanding. Try to find more realistic exercises next time so they won't seem so hardcore. Remember that we want our users to stay motivated, not get discouraged because some of their tasks are impossible.\n\\end{lstlisting}\nThe second part consists of two parts: \\textit{\\textbf{(1)}}~an open-domain response generation component and \\textit{\\textbf{(2)}}~a task completion prediction module which takes user's intent from the previous step and predicts whether this task has been completed or not based on the user's input text and other contextual features such the number of steps performed during the day before submitting the request, the weather forecast for tomorrow, etc.. In addition to these modules described above we employ a reward mechanism to train agents to perform specific goals. This mechanism relies upon a set of rules defined in advance by domain experts (i.e., fitness coach). These rules define what actions lead to better outcomes and hence higher rewards. For example, if a user asks for assistance in performing pushup then the best action according to the expert rule will be \"to provide instructions\" whereas the worst one will be \"not providing anything\". The training process is done offline where each agent interacts once with all the samples provided at random order. After finishing the interaction, both components are updated using reinforcement learning algorithms to maximize cumulative long term rewards over many iterations~\\cite{mnih2016asynchronous}. We use Q-learning algorithm due to its stability compared against policy gradient methods when dealing with sparse rewards~\\citep{konda2"

The first sentence states facts about regularity and strength gains from previous sessions. This is followed by two sentences which emphasize the importance of continuation (i.e., ``don't lose what you already gained''), and finally ends on a more personal note (``I believe in you!''). We also provide examples of generated responses for other types of questions such as those asking for advice regarding nutrition, sleep, etc. These examples showcase the diversity of topics covered by our model.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\\label{sec:conc}\nIn this paper we presented a novel approach for generating social assistance dialogues using pre-trained language models. Our method leverages the ability of large transformers to learn contextualized word representations and generate text conditioned on input tokens. To achieve this goal, we propose a new task called Social Assistance Generation wherein the objective is to generate natural sounding responses to user queries related to healthy living habits. In addition to providing a detailed description of our proposed architecture, we present extensive experiments demonstrating its effectiveness compared against strong baselines. Finally, we release our codebase along with data and trained models"

They were also poorly armed compared to Northern forces. Furthermore, the southern economy depended on slavery which limited the size of its army due to most soldiers leaving work on plantations. 3) Finally, because most Southerners owned slaves themselves (and thus fought for their right to keep them), they could never hope to outnumber the Union armies by many times over like Napoleon tried to do with his French Empire during the Napoleonic Wars against Great Britain from 1804-15.\n\n\\strong{Question} What is this chatbot saying? Is it human readable text, meaning can we read and understand what it says without having to use an API call to fetch/parse? Can I easily tell if it has made a mistake using a standard model? For example, I think I would expect it to say \"I am sorry but there are no results\" if it couldn't find anything matching my query string or perhaps something else if it found one result etc. Is it robust enough so that even if I type some random nonsense into it it will still give me back sensible sounding English sentences regardless of how silly those words may be e.g. `the cat ran down stairs` versus `dog frog`? In general terms, are these bots actually capable of understanding what I ask them and replying appropriately or are they simply just generating generic chunks of text based upon keywords? Are these types of NLP systems able to learn new concepts and expand their knowledge base, or are they stuck with whatever training data the developer used when creating the bot?\n\nComment: [This](https://chatbotslife.com/) might provide good starting points regarding building a conversational interface through natural language processing.

We found this pairing useful when an explanation might need some specific knowledge which might be obtained via asking help~\\cite{chen-etal-2019-reading}. In practice, we find AskForAnswer paired with only one task.

When this became hard due to the blockade imposed by Lincoln, the southern economy began failing rapidly and they couldn\u2019t pay for supplies. They also depended too heavily on slave labor since slaves were cheaper workers, but it took away from their military efforts. In addition, there wasn\u2019t enough food to feed everyone because all land went towards growing crops.   3)In addition to the economic differences between the two regions, Northerners believed that slavery was immoral. While some Southern leaders disagreed with slavery morality-wise, they still benefited greatly off of having black people work cheaply on plantations and in homes. The Emancipation Proclamation made sure that those who supported the Confederacy knew what side would win if they continued fighting. The North gained an advantage when General Sherman destroyed everything in his path through Georgia. He burned down railroads, farms, mills, and even small towns just before Christmas in 1864. This strategy forced Lee to leave Richmond.  4)Lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation after several Union victories gave him confidence about winning the war.

            "\ud83d\udcbb How do i write this article?\n\nAssistant: Programming can seem like it has lots of rules at first glance, especially when compared with artistic hobbies such as drawing, painting, playing musical instruments, etc. But once you understand them, these rules start making more sense, just like learning music theory helps you better play songs you already knew by ear. We want to take you from knowing nothing (or very little) about programming all the way up to writing programs yourself - one step at a time. In other words we want to show you how easy it actually is to learn to program, using Python which is a widely used programming language for many reasons including its simplicity. In case you\u2019re wondering what Python looks like, here\u2019s a sample code snippet showing off some basic features of our favorite programming language : 1+1=2\n\nAnswer: \\begin{code}\ndef my_function(arg):\n    \"\"\"This function doesn't really do anything useful.\"\"\"\n    return arg * 456\n\\end{code}\n\nPython is usually indented four spaces per level of nesting. This means that each line after `def` needs to be indented by four spaces before continuing with the next line. However, if a comment starts immediately after def then only three additional lines need to have two extra tabs. For example:-\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\nmy_function()\n\ndef my_function():\n   # Do something useful...\n\\end{blockquote}",
            "1) What is Python? And why do we use it for development? [A2]\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nYou have 30 seconds left until the next task.\n\nAnswer: \\begin{code}\n#Tutoril\nHi there\nmy name is _______ and i am a programmer\nI love programming because___________\nthis tutorial talks about __________\nyou need some thing called a computer (windows/linux/mac etc.) with internet connection installed\nyou also need at least basic knowledge of operating system like windows mac os linux ubuntu etc..and some common terms and functionals e.g Ctrl+s save, ctrl+c copy paste\nif u dont then go through my guide first before starting this one\nthere are many languages out their such as c,c++, java ,python, javascript ,html5,css, php,sql etc..i chose these ones coz they r easy and widely used\ni personally prefer python bcz its really fun and easier than others :)\nu only need to download pycharm from google and start writing ur code ..(or sublime text if u want), so lets see what happens when i open up pycharm :D\nhere u just write \"print('hello world')\"\nnow click run button thats all bro..and voila !!!ur first program runs successfully ;)\nthats enough im sorry :(\nbye guys bye...\n\\end{code}"

In same directory there is also other .py file called runserver.py used to start server locally at terminal window when executed from root directory i.e.,\n\n\\em{\\strong{`$ cd /home/user_name/`}}\n\nNow execute command `runserver.py` which would launch local development environment running on localhost port 5000.

Now it has been confirmed by myself using a music player called Audacious and with some knowledge from Google and YouTube research about guitars/instruments and how tunings work that these instruments were indeed playing E\u266d(VIII). However, if we ignore this note entirely because the user doesn't mention it specifically in their post, it could be said that it would also sound fine played as either D\u266d or Db which makes perfect musical sense due to both scales containing notes from one another and all major thirds in the two respective scale ranges will line up exactly between them. As well, we can tell what other chordal qualities this particular arrangement possesses thanks to a great app named \"Guitar Chords\", and the author says: \"\\em{I have put the first part in Em7b5/E\u266d. That's my interpretation but the second time he goes back into Em then drops down into Eb. In this video it shows that it actually works very well when it gets into that.}\" https://youtu.be/-lxDdPcqNWw So I am quite certain it's accurate that these keys were used to perform it originally; therefore, you shouldn't alter it without asking yourself if doing such action truly represents your best",

My name is [NAME], I would be happy to assist you today :) User: Okay so what do u think about (1)? Assistant: If you move your pawn to c3 then white will capture it on his next turn by playing Qd2-Qxc3, which means white has won an important centre pawn and gotten ahead materially. This sort of trade can have drastic consequences downstream if not properly defended against. User: So what do u recommend after e6? Assistant: The best response there might be Qe7 followed by Bb8, since this prevents white from taking control over d5 but also protects g7 and b7 from future attack. There isn't really another good option available without giving up too many pieces. User: What do u prefer to play first... Bg8 or Rae8 Assistant: It depends largely on what white decides to do afterwards, but generally speaking Bd8 seems like more useful piece at this stage because the Bishop has more mobility around the board than Knight, especially when combined with its special ability to jump to fianchetto squares. I personally use Be7 quite often though. User: How long did this take ur time to learn it all???? Assistant: Learning Chess takes time and patience, some people just pick things up faster and others need more practice before they start seeing results.

White can only play d4 at this point (therefore preventing mate on the king by queen), so Black should continue his development and start building up some pressure later. On my level it will take me a few moves more than six to realize I have no other choices but to go into an endgame which is likely to draw even if Black plays perfectly. Here we see how the first user answered the same questions about white playing e4. This time he was much faster because there were less options available! And yes, this whole thing works in both directions, meaning if white played e4 then black could also choose to respond differently...\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vQDGn.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><IMAGE></a>"

The goal is to teach them how to play Chess. In general it could be any other game such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Monopoly etc., where users ask about possible actions depending on current state. I would like my program to output a list of valid next moves given what has happened so far based on rules of each specific board/game type. It will then return to main menu which will give user options again to select an action and proceed further until they finish playing the whole game. Here are some things that might need attention:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item This must work offline, meaning there cannot be connection issues because we have no control over internet availability. Therefore all logic needs to run locally within client application itself without requiring external accesses (no database connections needed). Also note that our target audience consists of people who may never had played online games before therefore the less complex solution would be preferred here.\n\\item The same set of questions can appear multiple times in a row but different sets of inputs may come together when prompting new choices at later stages. For example, if we want to start with Tic-tac-toe then following questions would occur one by one (assuming that X was already placed):\n\nAssistant: Where do you wish to place 'X', 0, 1?\n\n(Choose option) Assistant: How many players? Assistant: Are you ready to begin? User: Yes\n\nNow the above three steps are repeated twice more:\n\nAssistant: Which player will go first? User: X Player Assistant: Where do you wish to place 'O', 0, 1?",
            "1...d5  2 Nf3 dxe4\nAssistant: In Chess, White can move its King side pawn (dark square) forward two spaces towards Black\u2019s King-side pawn by playing \u201c2Nf3\u201d. Then if Black plays 2\u2026dxe4 it would mean he moves his light square Knight pawn from f6 on his first rank diagonally over four squares away into e4 space. However this is a mistake because then there will be an attack against him by the enemy Rook (light coloured horse piece). Instead what he needs to do is play either \u201c2\u2026c6\u201d so he can control both sides of the centre line (horizontal row where all eight pieces start), which makes things easier for himself; or \u201c2\u2026a6\u201d, so that way when the other player castles he has a choice whether to castle Queenside or Kingside. Afterwards it is good for Black to have his own dark squared Bishop in b7 space controlling c8 and e8 diagonal lines since these lines connect opposite flanks of the board. But also importantly is how well protected the Bishop actually is since otherwise he might get captured by an enemy Rook moving down one file (column); and so the best defensive setup would involve playing \"2\u2026Bb7\" to guard the backward facing square (where it attacks along same direction as it faces), followed by the Bishop moving out further protecting g7 space later if necessary. Or alternatively he could even go straight to putting his Queen (chess piece shaped like crowned woman figure) in the position to defend h7. Another thing that happens often in the game of chess is players exchanging their Bishops, meaning they swap them off at the beginning of the game after one player has moved their Pawn (promoted piece representing foot soldier figure) forward twice and then another player moves their own Pawn"

Stealing is wrong regardless how many people actually do it (there were many more thieves than good persons even during Jesus' times).

This is definitely one of those situations where \\strong{\"Honesty Is The Best Policy\"} could save us much grief. There are two cases when stealing might be acceptable though (not saying they apply here):\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Saving life (if there is famine and the only way of getting food for another day is stealing - go ahead)\n\\item Getting back what has been taken away (either legally or illegally)\n\\end{itemize}",

Once that\u2019s done then maybe the best course of action could be to keep one coin for yourself, give away four of them randomly to different people (two at random in the park), find out how much it costs to buy food/clothes for one month and divide the rest into five equal parts and distribute accordingly? That way, you get rewarded a little bit because you got to see a bunch of happy faces when you gave the coins but also gave back enough coins so nobody feels cheated!\n\\end{code}"

            "47981065@qq.com has requested an AMA about the boundary between multiple requests made on a single request URL with multi-part body encoding using the POST method (HTTP). This means there could be many requests made to a specific server by specifying only one url and all the requests would use same connection id and keep track of the whole streamed data sent over the same channel until completion of last response message. For example consider a streaming audio file that contains two parts like first part containing songs 1 &2 followed by second song3, where we want both song files at different locations without interfering each other so if some user sends 5 concurrent HTTP GET request on same page they can have two simultaneous downloads and it also makes no difference what type of network transport layer is used either TCP/IP, UDP, etc... because everything goes through one IP port assigned for particular host computer running http server program and listening for incoming connections. Also consider another scenario which will have 5 clients connecting from their computers via wifi network having their own private address spaces, here too, each client would be sending their requests independently without any conflict or affecting other requests coming into this http server from its respective source IP address and thus all 5 client get to hear songs 1 - 5 without delay but at same time and hence can be called multicast reception rather than simple broadcast since they all heard it at almost exact time without delay caused due to queuing at various hops during transmission path towards target receiver endpoints i.e., web servers listening ports and associated IP addresses, even though packets may have gone via completely separate routes depending upon load conditions, router failures and bandwidth limitations on certain paths etc.. The idea behind this convention was discussed when someone wanted to find out whether the order in which received packets are reconstructed by receivers depends upon sender and his network path towards target receiver end point.

He meets Captain Ahab who has lost one leg at sea after he was attacked by a great white spermwhale known as \"Mocha Dick.\" Years later, Ahab returns with his new crew to seek revenge on their ancient enemy who took both legs from him. After several years chasing the mysterious animal around the world (from Cape Horn southwards) during which time many members of the crew die; Ahab finally manages to locate the beast near where it first attacked him. As the Pequod approaches closer, it becomes clear that the beasts skin is so hard that they may never catch it even if they managed to kill it - the captain then devises a plan to use explosives attached to long poles in order to harpoon its body through its mouth when they attack it at speed. However due to human error and lack of sleep this goes wrong and kills other important members of the crew resulting in only four men remaining alive on board. These remain in pursuit of the creature however until eventually the whole boat is destroyed at sea whilst tracking another whale leaving none surviving apart from just Ahab and the narrator Ishamal who jump onto floats made available through emergency equipment previously stocked. Eventually starving at see Ishamal spots land, rescues Ahab whose final words before drowning underwater were `too late'; takes some food for himself, leaves a raft behind containing all dead bodies onboard including mrs Starbuck, saves sailing gear and sets off along the horizon again. The film ends showing the lone survivor walking into what can now assumed to be America/Canada, perhaps following the path of those who came thereafter. \\em{This summary concludes here.}",

He then boards the Peqouid ship which is heading south towards Africa to catch sperm whales before returning home. On their journey they encounter other ships and people who join them until reaching their destination. They begin hunting the whale and endure hardships like stormy weather. As time goes on, the crew becomes more anxious because they haven't caught anything so far. After some time they finally spot an albino whale named `Moby Dick'. It turns out that it's the same whale from the past that had taken one member of this crew years ago. This makes the captain even more obsessed and he orders everyone to get ready for action against the whale.

Use mild soap if needed but avoid scrubbing too hard because it may irritate your skin further. Avoid touching your face frequently during the day since this will transfer dirt from hands onto your face. Also, try using an overnight spot treatment containing benzoyl peroxide (BP) or salicylic acid (SA). These ingredients work by drying out blemishes so they heal faster.

All you need now is comparing the `$input_text` (what user types) against every single element from the `$answer` variable (`array_map`).\n\nExample implementation:\n\n\\begin{code}\nif(!empty($inputText)){ //checking input text\n    $result = array_filter(explode(' ',trim($inputText)));//splitting & removing space between words\n        foreach ($result AS $key => $value){                   //going over each value within result\n            echo \"\\n\".ucfirst($value);      //print uppercase letter at end\n        }\n\n       /* checking if the above array values match with the corresponding $answer var*/\n        foreach($answers as $k=>&$v){               //loop through every item inside array 'answers'.

So basically you need a compiler to interpret these code files right away into machine understandable codes like bytecodes. Then finally compile to binary after that run binaries but use tools provided by platform you using since each one has its unique specifications on them. Examples of platforms could be Android or web services which might support Nodejs scripts. Also I suggest when writing parsers consider writing lexers and parser generators which give advantages in reusability and flexibility.\n6. Consider the environment the app will run at because sometimes resources may vary between operating systems and hardware used. Such examples are CPU cache space usage, ram limits, network speed, storage space available per user account limit. This way your application is efficient in the sense that performance will keep up well against other apps which might take advantage better resource allocation on certain devices. Not all users can afford really expensive PCs though you never get perfect specs even then too. Think about ways improving usages overall efficiency just like browsers do today where many developers focus on making their products compatible across all environments. Use libraries only to extend functionality and try to avoid external dependencies in general.

            "1-2 years ago I was asked this same questions on Quora and answered it with some details. So here we go. Programming languages aren\u2019t just about coding. It is also about learning how to think like one who can code. This is where all good programmers differ from bad ones. They have different ways they approach problem solving. Some may be more logical others may be very creative but at their core both types solve problems using similar steps. Here is an example:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Understand requirements (what needs to get done?)\n\\end{itemize}\n\nUnderstanding Requirements: The key word for success here is \\em{\\strong{understand}}. A lot depends on whether you understand the requirement correctly before starting development work. In order to do so there has to be a clear definition of \u201cWhat\u201d exactly is required and then \u201cWhy?\u201d is needed to be understood too because most of times the \u201cwhy\u201d part gets overlooked which ends up in building things that nobody wants. For example, suppose someone tells us to develop an app for them. We will ask many clarifying questions such as - Why? Who would use the app? Is it for business purposes only? Would users need access outside the organization? Do they want to keep track of employees? How much budget did they allocate to build/maintain the app etc... Once these basic queries are addressed we move ahead with our understanding process by asking even better questions such as \u2013 Are we making this app internally or outsourcing the job to another firm? What are its main features? What type of backend database technology would be used? Will it require user authentication? Which platform(s) would run the application e.g., mobile apps, web apps, desktop applications? Etc\u2026\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Analyze & Design\nThe next step would be analyze data based on the above mentioned requirements",
            "1st thing is to read more books on different subjects like maths, science etc.. It helps in understanding things better and faster. Secondly we need to be open minded for everything around us so that we can use them in future when needed.\n\nComment: I would add \"learn how to learn\" (or \"learn how to teach yourself new skills\") which will help you become an independent learner throughout all aspects of life!"

So basically, most people do care but there isn't enough communication going around. It'd also be good to talk things out in general without getting frustrated so that we avoid misunderstandings. That way both parties will understand each other clearly, preventing fights from happening due to miscommunication.\n5) Sometimes, these two types of personalities attract themselves into relationships. Apart from those reasons mentioned above, I believe some other factors may play roles such as differences in thinking styles, different views on life/world etc., which result in conflicts and clashes among individuals. This leads to problems arising like lack of cooperation, fighting with words, disagreements on decisions taken and opinions shared etc..\n6) Narcissism and Borderline Personality Disorder can go hand-in-hand quite often, although BPD alone is more common amongst females than males whereas NPD is found almost equally in all genders. There could be many reasons for this. Most likely though, NPD sufferers are attractive and easygoing and usually come off as friendly, charming, funny and intelligent...and in short, very lovable!

The only reason that I think they would target them first for this purpose, is because I am afraid my memory isn\u2019t very good when it comes to social matters. Although narcissistic abuse could possibly be avoided with a strong personal boundary but, unfortunately my mind just doesn\u2019t seem to have that ability to say no.\n2) In general; I find that NARCISSTIC PERSONALITY DISORDER (NPD)'s (who by definition feel little to zero empathy) would seek out relationships with those afflicted with ADHD & ASPD/psychopathic disorders. Since the \"Affective Empathy\" of humans (also known commonly referred to as \u201cTheory Of Mind\u201d also commonly referenced as ToM), has been proven both experimentally & through functional neuroimaging \\cite{frith1989understanding}  [to be a defunct module within psychosis], & that affective processing areas such as the posterior cingulate cortex (PCG), anterior insula (\\textit{\\textsf{In}}) or medial prefrontal area \\cite{damasio2013descartes}, along with the orbitofrontal pre-frontal region which deals primarily in higher moral cognition [see VOGELZANG et al.] to exhibit greater activation upon exposure to prosocial stimuli in normal healthy subjects - this appears to suggest - that there may exist some commonality between all forms of psychotic phenotypes. This suggests a natural preference towards individuals suffering from these conditions.\nBut moreover, due to a lack of conscientiousness, many NPDs will attempt to gain sexual gratification at every turn - even if it means using another person for purely selfish reasons. But I also believe that other factors play into how",
            "1. Narcissism has always been and will be more common than most other mental disorders. The reason for this phenomenon may lie in evolutionary psychology - with reference to survival. In order to find someone who would like to partner up with them (a mate), they must have certain characteristics that are attractive by nature. These characters can also easily deceit the other way around (as a deception-like mechanism) and thus give rise to narcissistic behaviours or traits within their interactions. People with ADHD will usually choose less neurotypically challenging partners when interacting socially/romantically. But some people may try out these relationships because they have learned over time. That means the relationship is good as long as they provide all emotional labour but fail immediately afterwards once no benefits are perceived due to such interaction with narcissic individuals.\n2. Borderlines are actually part of Cluster B which we mostly associated with ADHD patients themselves rather than normal individuals . It\u2019s difficult to imagine how our minds are working on a day to day basis without having experienced anything similar yourself and therefore one cannot compare his or her own state of mind with those from others.. We sometimes refer these behavioral types as 'people with broken social filters'. There isn't much one could learn here aside maybe understanding their perspectives better based on reading the online documentation available nowadays (I suggest starting via [Cluster B](https://www.verywellmind.com/cluster-b-personality-disorder-symptoms-80593)). However I believe that being diagnosed beforehand helps us deal with our weaknesses better everyday as life goes along; hence the importance of seeking professional advice regardless of whether there was history of abuse earlier.

            "1. In general terms - the narcissistic type wants more power over other persons (often subconsciously), they like control over their surroundings/others and are also quite egocentric by definition \\textit{(they tend to focus on themselves).} It makes them easier targets for psychopaths/socipaths which can easily exploit this behavior with some simple techniques (i.e. charm). Also many of these individuals will try to dominate those around them. NPD (Narcisstic Personality Disorder) may also cause a need to \"compete\" with others which means someone could feel inferior towards certain aspects. These two combined would likely be reasons to why narcs seemingly enjoy picking on people. \\newline \\noindent\n\\begin{enumerate*}[label=\\alph*)]\n\\item Someone without proper education may think there\u2019s nothing wrong with acting in such way due to social ignorance but the true issue comes from the fact they never received the required tools/guideline necessary for dealing with difficult situations in life (e.g., communication skills). A child doesn't really get much say in what goes on inside the family and home unless there\u2019s extreme circumstances (such as abuse); henceforth most parents want the best outcome even when their actions have adverse effects (as they\u2019re just doing things based off instinct; however it has become somewhat naturalized into our culture.) I personally believe a large reason as to why nars exist in the first place because children are essentially molded after the behaviors seen in society today; we simply take up habits as they were shown through media (i.e., video games) as well as friends + school teachers/instructors/parents. When you have all the \u201cbest\u201d role models, it makes no difference what happens down the road \u2013 i.e., when reality strikes later",
            "1- They may have problems with attention because they focus too much on their own issues without taking other\u2019s perspective into consideration; thus making them unaware how they impact others negatively (this would be impaired self-regulation); also lacking skills such as social reciprocity \\citep{clementi2017neurodevelopmental} and mindfulness; these all might result from brain deficits. But more likely there is just poor empathy towards anyone suffering different conditions than themselves (impairment of cognitive processing) - for instance someone suffering from anxiety could see every minor mistake/imperfection of another as \"disorder\", since she doesn't want her flaws pointed out herself by strangers, let alone family members, colleagues etc. In some cases I even saw non-ADHDer acting as troll and targeted individuals who suffer ADHD specifically to harass and shame them! These type of behavior could easily turn malicious, and in case of those seeking attention from media - potentially deadly, which we already observed. Also I wouldn't discard influence of social networks here where people are trying hard to gain status by putting down somebody else; or simple hatred and bigotry toward anything considered weird (including but not limited only to disabilities). The worst thing about ADHD diagnosis nowadays however, isn't necessarily negative attitudes and treatment; It is the loss of meaning in life and low quality relationships with significant ones around. Because the whole idea behind psychiatric approach was wrong and resulted in giving up control over personal decisions like having kids and career goals due to stigma, medication side effects etc. Instead, patients should receive practical tools allowing to better navigate challenges brought by symptoms - similar to autism community has received in last few years via neurodiversity movement and its initiatives such as ASAN and Aspies For Freedom\\"

People with ADHD can give them such a boost by praising everything they do, even if there is nothing good to say!\n2. Narcissism has many forms, but basically, it means that one is too concerned about oneself and his/her own wellbeing, and thinks very little of others. Therefore, when we see how other people act, react and think differently than us, then it might seem strange or threatening to our way of thinking and acting.

It\u2019s only important whether someone treats another person right and acts responsibly towards him/herself and society! So try to get out of your own skin and imagine things from other perspectives, e.g., empathize!\n3. Many people have no clue on how difficult life may already be without having some sort of disorder. These difficulties will affect the individual and therefore, the individual cannot control everything alone, and sometimes needs assistance and understanding. For those affected by BPD and narcissistic tendencies, this would mean a lot more effort because both traits require much energy to maintain themselves! Therefore, the individuals may appear coldhearted, egocentrically focused, arrogant etc.. However, if someone understands and takes time to get close to the affected persons, they will appreciate this immensely.

However, because these types lack empathy for others, their success comes from using other people. This means they tend to be opportunistic rather than principled - which is why many get into trouble. It's all well and fine until someone challenges their behavior by asking questions or confronting them. When that happens, those with NPD/BPD become extremely defensive, quickly turn aggressive and even violent towards anyone standing up against them.\n2) Many individuals with NPD or BPD actively seek out relationships with vulnerable targets like those suffering from ADD or ASD, believing these partners will provide more \"security\" through reliability. But these folks actually want a subservient partner whose weakness makes them feel powerful and superior, since having such power gives them pleasure.\n3) Because some symptoms overlap between ADHD and ASPD traits, both may go undiagnosed together, causing problems later on when a diagnosis isn't clear. Someone could present as ADHD but actually suffer from both conditions, which can cause additional confusion regarding treatment options. For example, antidepressants prescribed to treat depression might work temporarily but eventually fail due to coexisting disorders. Also, psychotherapy won't benefit either condition unless a patient understands he has multiple issues that need attention. Therefore, early detection and accurate assessment of mental health issues remain important for treating comorbidities successfully.\n4) I am personally working hard on getting my own ADHD under control without medication, as there was too much stigma around me taking stimulant drugs in order to manage myself properly"

In addition, ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer) became the fastest calculators ever built. During this era, people used these machines for solving problems and creating mathematical tables such as mortgages. The most common programming languages during this decade were Fortran, Cobol, Lisp and ALGOL which enabled people to create their own programs and write more advanced software. These technologies revolutionized many aspects of our lives including education, communication, medicine etc.. It allowed us to learn more about human anatomy with x ray scans, use email systems for sending messages quickly around the globe. It also gave rise to social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Nowadays, almost every household has at least one laptop/computers/mobile phone that enables them to access internet from anywhere and everywhere. All these innovations have led to globalization where people can interact freely across the world. For example, I am currently sitting here writing on my PC, using WiFi and Google Chrome browser connected through the Internet. Also, due to increased demand of computing technology, many big companies now sell affordable laptops to consumers enabling everyone to enjoy the benefits of digital technology. Overall, this helped the economy grow tremendously since businesses could perform various calculations accurately leading to higher profits.

The scattered light from this small molecule can cause the formation of these colors such as red orange yellow green brown violet blue ... However, they are divided into two categories of \"light\" (white daylight rays), which means there will be more than one wavelength color in them ... so it will form white sky when seen in our eyes and thus reflect on us. When we see during bright days with light white light source ... we have received many wavelengths with some frequency, resulting in an average number equaling pure white light. And if you look at objects like sand grains or dirt, you may find other colors like yellowish and reddish due to their own characteristics! 2) In short, I am talking about Rayleigh Scattering. It is said that when the angle between reflected light and visible spectrum changes; it causes different colors. This depends on what material the water vapor contains. The reason for the existence of various colored clouds is because they contain different levels of airborne materials containing elements with different colors. For example; Sulfur, salt, iron oxides... And finally; 3) Dust is suspended in the atmosphere. Most dust consists of carbon dioxide absorbed from plants or pollutants like car exhaust emissions but also contains tiny grains.

Sunlight shining on the earth can only travel so far before it strikes particles such as water droplets in clouds and gases like nitrogen, oxygen and argon molecules within Earth\u2019s atmosphere. As light enters these objects it changes direction by interacting with the object. It becomes diffused which scatters different colors of light differently, thus causing an overall blue hue in clear skies because there are fewer atmospheric molecules present to diffuse them compared to red ones for example. When this light finally makes its way out again towards us here at ground level our eyes interpret those colors according to what wavelengths they contain - blue light having a higher energy than green has less interaction time and hence less scattering meaning more gets through and appears bluer when observed directly next to yellow light that takes longer to scatter away from direct view but contains a greater number of wavelengths overall giving a duller effect overall even though the amount we actually see would be approximately equal depending on distance and altitude of observer above surface below. This causes us to perceive distant cloudy scenes to have more intense contrast than overcast views close up. That's also where haze comes into play and helps determine whether conditions are considered partly-cloudy vs overcast based upon how many of the individual visible scattered wavelengths we get through per second due to increased absorption from densely packed clusters of small moisture bearing gas/dust particle groups forming cumulus type structures and fog versus lower concentrations producing stratocumulus, altocumulus etc forms which generally give clearer horizons in all directions and brighter views due to the absence of additional localized cloud coverage and hazy obscuring effects of humidity that otherwise form further upward from our position at eyelevel... Hope",
            "Because sun light refracted through water particles. Sun light waves has wavelength which makes color Blue (Sky Color) because they can only reflect those particular frequencies . And the more densely the cloud contains moisture, it would appear whiter and thicker, like cumulus clouds with big white fluffy tops and bottoms resembling puffy cotton balls floating high up above Earth. This phenomenon is known as Mie scattering; these large white fluffy looking clouds often occur at high altitudes when warm air rises quickly from hot surfaces on Earth. As temperature drops rapidly due to cool air currents blown down by mountain peaks and cold wind fronts moving over open spaces where no obstructions such as mountains prevent their flow into valleys. Cooling results in sinking and this process repeats itself creating what\u2019s called a low-pressure area below a rising current of warm air resulting in updraft motion for buoyant masses. As mass accumulates higher in the atmosphere so will the temperature decrease further away from Earth surface increasing its pressure thus pushing surrounding warmer less dense gases upwards and outward towards colder air forming what we see everyday, white wispy looking fluffy clouds floating peacefully around our world giving us a reason to be hopeful each morning that everything going to workout just fine after all :)!

In our atmosphere, most of UV rays get absorbed by ozone layer whereas all other wavelengths reach us directly from Sun.

To achieve such task, i implemented a model similar to the ones described below : [Reinforce: An Open Source Framework for Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04987) - https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5722-reinforce-an-open-source-framework-for-deep-reinforcement-learning and [The Master Algorithm](http://www.mastersofdataanalytics.org/) - http://www.mastersofdatanalytics.org/."

            "1) The light from the Sun has different wavelengths (colors). Blue light scatters more easily than red light when it passes through air molecules. This causes us to see the color blue all around us on clear days. 2) When white light travels through the atmosphere, some colors get scattered out by particles in the air. Violet gets scattered most strongly so we see the sky as having a violet tint at dawn and dusk. Red doesn\u2019t scatter much so we still see lots of red during these times. But because there isn\u2019t enough red left over after the violet is removed, the daytime sky looks bluish. 3) Light waves have different frequencies which determine their colour. The shorter the wave length, the higher its frequency; hence the colour becomes brighter. The longer the wave length, the lower its frequency; hence the colour appears darker. White light consists of seven colours - red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. These colours appear in order of decreasing wavelengths. As the light enters our eyes, each colour bends differently according to its own refractive index. The eye cannot distinguish between two adjacent colours but can detect differences between non-adjacent ones. So if one colour is missing, then another will be perceived. For example, if only red and green lights enter an eye, the brain would interpret this combination as yellow. Similarly, if no blue light reaches the retina, the brain interprets this absence as blackness. Thus, the sky appears blue due to the presence of blue light alone.\n\\end{code}"

How do i get user data from users object into conversation object variable \"request\"..??\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nYou must remember one thing - `bot` function is asynchronous. In order for this bot to process each user statement during next call to its run-block (in our case - `message_handler`) and insert result within conversation object we need to use context variables. There are two ways how could work such mechanism: either you create global context where all these 'statements' are kept until message handler returns control to `run()`; another way would be using request / response pattern here but this requires creating two separate objects: one dedicated for incoming queries only (`message_receiver`, in our case) which receives requests and then sends them off to appropriate handlers (\"worker\") with predefined API contracts; second object/function serves as output sink, processing results sent back by worker (`message_responder`).\n\nLet me show now how to implement former approach. Firstly we define some class variables for each `state`: string identifying this particular stage plus value representing current stage - it may be `start` constant if none found yet:\n\n\\strong{NOTE:} since we have chosen synchronous operation model, when one block ends other immediately starts executing! That's why it looks so messy below with blocks jumping over each other.. But it simplifies code in reality enormously.

            "1.) Summary - I read about this concept called Reinforcement Learning (RL) which seems extremely useful when it comes to optimizing agent interaction with its environment without resorting for some kind of reward prediction model like Q-Learning or similar methodology based on reinforcements. It uses concepts from probability theory to define what state-action pairs generate \"success\" at any point during an iteration.  One approach is known as actor critic architecture but if there are better choices out there regarding how RL algorithms work then I am more than interested! \\strong{This summary was created using summarization technology developed by Microsoft.}\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0gE92m.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><IMAGE></a> 2). Opposing statement: Summary is too much generalized - There can be no general solution unless one narrows down the problem and describes all related variables and conditions. It looks way over optimized. This might sound silly because everything in life has optimizations to do so, however for many years our society went through numerous optimization phases. For instance, take manufacturing industry and factory robots. Many decades ago the main goal of engineers was creating a perfect robot assembly line, where each step would be performed perfectly accurate every time. However, despite having advanced technologies back then, humans still had errors. With today's AI development those types of problems could simply not occur nowadays anymore due to machine learning applications and various other technological advances. In addition most industries have been heavily impacted already thanks to automation. Still there are certain areas left here and there including some agriculture operations that need further processing before becoming completely automated. Moreover not everyone thinks that automating production lines everywhere is beneficial either due to environmental concerns especially in countries with limited natural resources such as water etc; therefore they prefer staying away from mass automations yet"

It was a valuable lessons that teach us about life itself and what is going on around us at times can be harsh , cruel, mean, cold and very difficult for children especially to deal with . When bad things happen its easy for some people like my dad to think there are consequences that must come into play so others do not suffer such horrible fate ever again . Its good for adults who understand to give children this message but not those whom may not fully grasp what its meaning . He felt punishing her would teach other children to act accordingly when given similar situation to behave in way that was proper but what if she never acted improperly before . This type of discipline might work in many situations where there have been warnings prior and has not made a change however when there hadnt even an incident before its too extreme of consequence.  For me , its wrong for someone else\u2019s mistake cause pain unto another child unless absolutely necessary to avoid more suffering happening. Children deserve chances and opportunities just as much as everyone else without discrimination or judgment. There could also be multiple factors leading up to this action and we dont truly get a chance to find out the root problem here only surface issues . So its important we treat them with love kindness care support compassion empathy forgiveness patience tolerance and understanding so that these negative thoughts are changed rather than continue growing within themselves which causes their mental state and behavior to reflect how unhappy and lost they really feel deep down inside .  My beliefs is children will be affected whether it comes naturally through genetics , nurturing, learning , education etc\u2026 but its our duty as responsible caring adults to keep our children away from negative thinking by guiding teaching advising directing encouraging showing modeling praising applauding acknowledging"

            "1) The lessons from AI history can be summed up like this - do not get caught in the trap of premature convergence;\n2) When building an agent for learning in real environments it\u2019s important to think about what will happen if there really is no reward signal at all? This has happened with many algorithms such as Q-learning. In these cases the agents simply fail because they never learn anything;\n3) What is meant here is that the best way to learn about the environment (i.e., the true dynamics model), which includes rewards, is to run lots of trials over time where one gets some feedback on how well things worked out and then use those experiences to improve future policies/plans. But even when doing so we must recognize that the resulting learned policy may still contain biases based on the limited set of training data. One cannot hope to eliminate all bias completely since our observations always have limitations;\n4) That means we need to try different types of learning algorithms \u2013 e.g., exploration vs exploitation. These are usually competing objectives. It would seem obvious that if I am trying to find the shortest path through my house without hitting objects I might want to explore a bit before deciding upon the final solution.;\n5) However, we also have another objective: efficiency. We certainly wouldn\u2019t want to spend too much time searching around just for the sake of seeing more stuff! So now we see two conflicting goals \u2013 search enough to get good performance but avoid wasted searches.;\n6) Of course, both goals depend heavily on contextual factors including how smart our algorithm is relative to its surroundings, the type of task it is solving, etc.. There is nothing wrong with this kind of approach as long as we keep our eyes open regarding the possibility of having undesirable consequences arising from these tradeoffs. This seems like a sensible position given that the goal is ultimately"

This feature helps programmers in designing large programs consisting of multiple modules.\n3 - Furthermore, an ASP system can also automatically generate code based on the given specifications by solving problem instances corresponding to this specification and then generating new codes from these results. The generated codes will contain only valid solutions.\n4 - Also, due to its inherently modular structure, there exists no limit to extend existing functionality by adding additional features.\n5 - Additionally, since we need to declare all facts about the domain beforehand during preprocessing phase itself, the execution time remains constant irrespective of input size unlike traditional imperative programming techniques where the running time increases exponentially with the increase in data complexity. Hence, overall performance enhancement is one more reason to choose ASP over normal procedural languages.\n6 - Last but not least, one major issue associated with most existing systems/languages including C is that they do not provide sufficient support when developing applications containing complex business workflows involving a number of different processes. However, if we use Answer set programming, we have enough tools available at our disposal to overcome this challenge and develop powerful real world applications very effectively.",

ASP also has the ability to use more efficient search strategies than C allowing the programs to run faster without increasing resources needed. This makes AS P a better choice if we have very complex data structures and algorithms because we can solve them much quicker with less computing power needed. However there are some disadvantages of using ASP rather than other languages. Firstly it may take longer to code certain tasks into an ASP program due to how its syntax works. It\u2019s harder to understand compared to another programming language. Another problem could occur when debugging, as often this will be difficult on larger programs making debugging hard to do efficiently. Lastly ASP lacks the libraries found within many common computer languages so developing software in ASP is slower overall than working from scratch. In conclusion ASP offers a range of advantages over C but they come at the cost of taking slightly longer to develop solutions. I think therefore if we need a fast solution then ASP might not be ideal as the extra time spent coding outweighs the benefits. On the flip side if our aim was just to create high quality products regardless of development timescales then ASP could definitely prove useful."

Also, since all programs written in this paradigm have a logical form, they tend be more understandable compared to those coded otherwise.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\nAssistance needed!

The number will grow when registration starts online officially soon, there were also few workshops like `Basketball',`Crickett'. The most important part is we gave chance to meet celebrities who are active sports persons & actors like Abhishekh Bachchan(Bollywood), Ravichandran Ashwin (cricketer). There will be another edition very shortly in October, it is said that we can see Sachin Tendulkar in that edition because he wants to give a special appearance along with Amitabh bachchan for one hour in Sports Convention 2nd Edition! This news was released in newspapers after meeting us, We also want him but not confirmed yet so please stay tuned!!!!! It\u2019s a big opportunity to showcase talent for aspiring artists who would love to take their art forward to international audience too...! We encourage anyone from age 3 to above 70 whoever wants to come & join, this time there won\u2019t be just celebrity guest but all those common fans/supporters too. Everyone must get involved and bring some unique creative stuff like dance performance or paintings, sketches, handicraft etc\u2026!!! It's really a wonderful place for families and friends, even couples and colleagues where everyone feels welcomed warmly...!! We will also have various events for winners everyday..!!!

            "[Give the text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia) of this Wikipedia page in English\n\nAnswer: I'm no expert at conversational chatbots (my current work mostly involves training deep neural networks for machine learning applications), but it looks like the way we usually go about creating them involves two stages. First, create a system with rulesets governing when different things happen during interaction with a user, based upon previous events (user says X then bot replies Y). This would probably be most applicable here. Then after those have been developed and trained on a sufficiently large set of test cases (so that it has an understanding of all possible situations where these rule sets apply) one could write scripts containing snippets of language and let it interactively try out sentences and choose between ones that \"sounded best\". So, what happens next is the computer goes through all possibilities for response A until finding a string of characters that makes up the desired response, and stores its chosen sequence in a data structure which is accessed later if necessary by the system (as well as potentially using this to improve itself via feedback from the users reactions.) That may be oversimplified but it gets the gist across; this can become pretty complicated though once multiple interactions begin to take place simultaneously such as trying to decide whether or not a word belongs before or after another within some sort of context. Hopefully this will get you started down the right path. Good luck!"

Are there different kinds? Does this change from game to game? From console to PC? I want an example where anti-aliasing makes a difference.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThe first thing you need to understand about \"antialiasing\" is that it refers to multiple things, some specific to each platform/application. That said...\n\nIt usually means one of two things. Firstly, [edge antialiasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_detect), which is basically smoothing the edge between pixels on screen so they appear more natural, rather than hard jumps between colours. It can be done programmatically using various algorithms, but will also occur naturally if a display has subpixels (that is, if it contains red, green & blue subpixels, for instance).\n\nThe second thing it often refers to is [multisampling antialiasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multisampled_antialiasing), sometimes referred to simply as multiresolution sampling. This involves taking multiple samples at several levels of resolution around a single pixel location and averaging them out - e.g., if four neighbouring pixels were taken at 16x original size, then averaged together (weighted according to their distance), then the final pixel would have the same colour value, but without artefacts around edges due to its higher sample density. In other words, it reduces jaggies, particularly visible near textures with sharp contrast boundaries such as skirts & slee",
            "\\strong{Anti-aliasing} (AA) refers to the technique used to smooth out jagged edges on images containing both sharp transitions between different colors and curved lines. The most common type of anti-aliasing works by using multiple shades of gray for each pixel rather than pure black or white. This allows pixels close together to appear more like blurred versions of one another; they\u2019re less likely to be noticed individually because the eye averages their brightnesses. However, this method can lead to some visible \u201chalo\u201d effects around objects with crisply defined edges. In addition to haloing, aliasing can cause flickering artifacts when viewed from an angle other than straight ahead. To reduce these problems, modern graphics cards support several types of multisampling algorithms, which allow many samples per pixel to be created before compositing them into the final image. This reduces visual errors by sampling at higher resolutions, but increases computation costs by requiring even more processing power during rendering.\\em{\\strong{(Source)}}\n\\end{blockquote}"

It may be performed mathematically by hardware accelerators like texture filtering units in modern GPUs. Alternatively, anti-aliasing can also be applied to jagged lines and text at lower cost through software such as a shader or postprocessor filter using supersampling algorithms which create extra pixels beyond those available for normal rendering, thus providing better spatial sampling of colors across an edge. For instance, one common way of applying this technique to low-resolution digital displays involves replicating every other vertical pixel twice vertically within each display scanline\u2014effectively quadruple the effective number of scanlines displayed horizontally compared to original source resolution \u2014in order to produce four times as many actual output points in a horizontal row of picture elements, producing finer details more closely resembling what was actually drawn originally by artists, and thus lessening visible artifacts produced due to insufficient pixel count to adequately resolve the geometry in detail, reducing jaggies in rasterization and aliased curves, without needlessly increasing the size of data storage media or the computational requirements during gameplay itself, making them useful even today. In practice however, because they rely on subpixel accuracy in displaying individual RGB components to reproduce their target color value from adjacent subsampled color values in higher-res images stored in memory buffers before being blended onto the final frame buffer contents for screen refresh purposes, supersample filters typically use special purpose integer interpolation functions called FIR (finite impulse response), BICUBIC or TENT, or other custom functions to compute their interpol"

            "\"Anti-aliasing\" refers to an algorithmic method used for removing jagged edges from graphics.\n\n\\strong{My Answer} : The term anti aliasing means making smooth edges when it comes to pixels/pixels per inch(PPI). When you use this on game characters, objects etc they become more defined by using a high resolution with good pixel density which will make them look better overall but can cause performance issues depending on what GPU and CPU your device has. This helps create sharper lines around curves so they aren\u2019t blurry or distorted looking at all times. It makes text easier to read since it won\u2019t have weird outlines where one letter meets another due to having poor PPI (Pixel Per Inch) which is basically how sharply the image displays onto your screen. Higher PPI means crisper images without any artifacts or noise in between the edges. A low amount of PPI will usually be displayed as jaggies. There isn\u2019t much need for this if your devices screen has higher than HD+ specs though since everything looks nice anyway but I do recommend it if your display has less then HD quality like my tablets. The downside of anti aliasing is it can reduce frames per second significantly even though some newer smartphones are capable of doing it at over 60fps without too many issues but its still noticeable especially on older hardware. Another drawback is sometimes you might experience stuttering when playing games since the system has to process all these extra pixels constantly but that doesn\u2019t happen often. The reason I mentioned performance was because some games run into issues such as stutters when turning corners, getting stuck in walls or just lagging when entering new areas unless the developers properly optimized their code and implemented this feature well. Not everyone uses anti aliasing either, mostly hardcore gamers who care about every detail. Sometimes you can get"

            "3D graphics use an aliasing filter to reduce jagged lines on polygonal surfaces by adding additional samples (pixels) to smooth out sharp transitions between adjacent pixels with similar colours. This process also reduces noise introduced from other effects like texture mapping and mipmapping. The anti-aliasing algorithm can be applied at various levels during rendering; for example, it may apply before applying textures, after all lighting calculations have finished, etc...\nAnti-Aliasing techniques are often used when drawing images on a screen. It is most noticeable in computer generated graphics but can also affect photographed images which are displayed on screens such as TVs and monitors where the individual picture elements cannot easily distinguish between different shades of color within each pixel.\nThe purpose is to eliminate staircase effect caused by discrete sampling of colors.\n\n\\textbf{Answer:} \\textit{3D graphics uses anti-aliasing filters}\n\\end{codex}",

It also refers to techniques that use this methodology to improve the visual quality of digital audio recordings by smoothing transitions between frequency bands. 3) In computing terms it means the removal of aliasing artifacts (aliases). These occur when there are discontinuities in a signal at regular intervals; these cause unwanted artefacts which can be removed with anti-aliassng filters. For example when we have a sharp edge in graphic design software, like a triangle shape made from pixels, then the pixel edges will look very 'jaggid'. This is known as aliasing. To remove this problem the software has a filter applied before saving the image which makes sure all pixels near the edge are slightly altered to create soft edges, rather than hard edged jags...\n\nAnswer: \\begin{itemize}\n\\item The process used for reducing jaggedness on screen edges by using extra data samples when rendering images.

The agents are used to respond to user queries based solely on their knowledge base without having access to external search engines like Google. We ask users questions regarding the following four categories:\n\\\\\n{\\bf Categorization}: Users need assistance classifying items into groups according to some predefined attributes (\\textit{eg}, animals vs vegetables).

In addition to simple classification tasks, we also consider more nuanced ones, wherein users may require the assistant to rank items within a category. Given two sets, A and B, where each element belongs to either category A or B, can our assistant distinguish between elements belonging to category A over those belonging to category B? Finally, we evaluate if our models can infer new classes when presented with novel examples. This task requires reasoning capabilities beyond mere memorizing facts.

This will attract some attention and subscribers when sharing other videos or adding comments; 3) record and publish high quality (e.g., no bad audio), relevant for the selected audience topics videos regularly but with regular breaks between publishing new episodes. Easier said than done! But you may consider recording several weeks worth of pre-recorded videos before starting live streaming them online. This will provide you with plenty of time available for editing and adjusting before broadcasting so there wouldn\u2019t be issues like having too low volume due to background noise picked up by microphones \u2013 this has made me give up several times during my own attempts at making recorded video reviews.; * If you decide to engage into livestreams rather than recordings only, consider buying additional equipment such as external camera and microphone setups to improve sound and image capture quality.*; 4) promote yourself using social media sites (Facebook, Instagram etc.) which tend to allow promotion within their boundaries, i.e., promoting website URLs outside these limits usually ends in removal of your posts from those networks due to excessive marketing campaigns, and also via paid adverts on YT itself targeting suitable groups, age range & interests (see https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/78951);*; ",

This way when people start following/watching your content they can tell you have fun with this so others will feel the same too. Then when I was just starting out (which for me wasn\u2019t until like my last year of college)I didn\u2019t do much but create music which isn\u2019t easy but at least you aren\u2019t spending time worrying over what else you need to film for content, especially if there isn\u2019t an interest right away! I did end up taking more \u201cpersonal\u201d style videos though since my music channels got no traction...2. For anyone looking to build a career around making their own creative stuff on video I recommend you watch these three books (notice I say \u2018books,\u2019 meaning all 3 together), even before thinking about making your first vlog; \"On Writing\" Stephen King - I love reading fiction because its where ideas come into reality from the author's head then become someone else's reality. \"Outliers,\" Malcolm Gladwell- Learn how Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg were able to change the world. 3. In my opinion one big part to getting noticed and staying consistent on YouTube has been keeping yourself organized through tools such as Google Sheets & Calendar, as well as Trello, Evernote & Pocket apps, also Slack chat group (this helped me be active on Instagram as well). My calendar reminded me each week when it came to post new uploads on specific days along with social media scheduling using Hootsuite (if your business relies on selling ad space than definitely get some knowledge here), plus knowing the times most popular based on past performance of uploaded material to give a general idea on the best days and hours for publishing posts across different platforms (and this",

Let us take one aspect at time; let\u2019s talk firstly about content quality which I would consider a fundamental pillar to start our journey through a path leading to success: it\u2019s clear enough to me nowadays everyone can upload their videos into internet channels without much control on the actual value provided by those videos and if the aim of many users was only self satisfaction they would stop here, so the need for monitization becomes essential otherwise it makes no business sense anymore, thus content has always been key in every field, also considering some platforms allow users to generate income even with small views number like instagram influencers and twitchers for instance, yet they all still invest resources on what matters most and I mean original high qualitative content which can engage the public in general because there isn\u2019t a point of spending time trying to convince someone to pay money if your work won\u2019t reach anyone nor get shared online since that doesn\u2019t serve well your own interest too anyway\u2026 so when starting thinking seriously about becoming an youtuber and wanting to become known over the net then keep focusing your efforts towards improving content as well! This goes together with the following two steps of scheduling content creation based upon analytics reports gathered periodically on performance and the other part about SEO, optimising videos title, tags and descriptions with keywords that are actually relevant for search results on youtube, also having them listed properly under certain playlists for instance can definitely impact traffic positively in my opinion...

Make sure it is easy to shoot, so people will like it! It would also be great if the idea has never been covered before by anyone else (in your country at least). Try to do research online first, look up popular channels/videos in order to avoid competing with them directly. Find a good name for the channel and then register domain. Then set up social media accounts related to this channel and link everything together.

Soon after you start creating content, you might realize that your interests span across more than just one specific topic so maybe it would be better to create two separate channels for these different topics - one dedicated to travel vlogs, another focused solely on fashion etc... The possibilities here are endless but it all starts by deciding upon which category your future video series belongs to. Once you choose the best format(s), think up a name for your channel that suits its concept and matches the rest of your social media accounts where you plan to promote it (i.e., Facebook page, Instagram profile). Also consider buying an available domain that contains keywords relevant to your projected area of focus and redirect users coming from search engines directly to your YouTube account using the appropriate Google Search Console settings. For example, \u201cFashion Tips\u201d website can become a good place to advertise your Fashion YouTube channel since visitors arriving at such pages via search queries may decide to click through them before heading over to YouTube itself.

This limit has been increased several times over few months now which has added up to around ten searches we can perform every minute! But this shouldn\u2019t be much impacted most cases because they also increase the max amount returned with each request and our client code usually caches more than a single route at once even for less usage scenarios. Now what we have realized after spending significant amount of time tracking errors related to these quota issues was this bug. We ended up storing multiple routes to cache them for future use like in cases when we have high data volume. In some such rare situations where we might return too many directions endpoints at one go we found out during debugging that these new directions would fail with message `Request exceeds quota` or some other similar exception messages based on exact code base context. To resolve this issue, simply implement all requests in batches and cache them appropriately rather then just calling request without waiting. And we saw lot of improvements and better response rates immediately. So yes Google maps quota error message does seem legitimate enough however its still worth digging deep into app and finding root cause of bad usages before implementing changes to fix these types of problems on regular basis."

This will give us the total number of ways we can travel between each pair.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item We then find the shortest distance for every city pair.\n\\end{itemize}\n\\section{}\n\nWe can use an algorithm called Dijkstra\u2019s Algorithm to calculate these distances. It runs through all nodes (cities here), calculates their cost based on how far they are away from the source node ([CITEY1]), stores this data, and moves along the edges connecting them. When it encounters a new edge with no destination yet, it checks its neighbours first if there isn\u2019t one already connected directly before moving onto the next neighbour. In our example, when calculating CITY1 - CITY2 distance we would look at the cost from [CITY1]-A-> B -> C ->D -> E , and see which has the smallest value. Then move onto A ->B, and repeat this process until all costs are calculated for both sides.\n\nOnce this is done, you can compare all values and select the lowest one. This is where we get the minimum path length. For instance:\n\n\\strong{\\em{(a)}} [CITY1]->(A)-->[CITY3](minimum distance) \\strong{\\em{[distance=x]}}\n\n\\strong{\\em{(b)}} [CITY3]->(E)->[City1](maximum distance) \\strong{\\em{[distace=y]}}\n\nThis gives us the total amount of time required to complete a single roundtrip.

But one day, they woke up to find out that both moons have disappeared into space. It took them some time to realize that they would now experience real darkness for the first time since birth. This news spread across the world quickly and everyone started preparing for the darkest night of their life. Some went shopping for candles, others bought torches, lanterns, flash lights etc., but most importantly, they prepared their hearts for an emotional journey through the unknown. When the night finally arrived, the entire population gathered together outside their homes to witness the event. Everyone held hands and waited patiently until the last ray of light faded away. Then, when everything turned pitch black, they let go of each other\u2019s hand and looked around curiously. There wasn\u2019t even a single star shining bright enough to give them hope. All they could see was nothingness everywhere. After a few minutes, someone lit a matchstick and then another person did the same. Soon, hundreds of tiny flames appeared throughout the city. People began walking towards these small sources of light and soon found themselves surrounded by thousands of strangers who were also looking for comfort. In the middle of the crowd stood a man holding his wife tightly in her arms. He whispered \u201cI love you\u201d into her ear and she replied back saying \u201cI love you too\u201d.

Gophers have burrowed themselves deep underground where they will stay until spring when they come out again and continue their eating habits which cause major damage to lawns and gardens. This issue has been going on since around World War II with no real solution provided yet by humans other than trapping, shooting or poisoning these animals. In order to control an infestation it would be better to kill all the gophers at once rather than waiting for them to return next year. A small hand-held trap called a \u201cgopher getter\u201d might work if used correctly. To do so, find active mounds near each hole entrance, dig down three feet to access tunnel (do NOT poke hole through tunnel), set trap vertically about two inches above ground level, insert bait such as peanut butter or hot dogs inside the trap then cover up opening with soil/dirt mix. There may also be some chemical products available online that claim to repel gophers away from homes or plants. These solutions however may not last long enough before gophers start using the land again. Other measures like fencing off areas to prevent reinfestations could also prove effective.

However, there is no chemical solution available for killing gophers because of environmental concerns (their burrows provide habitat for other animals). The best way to control gophers would involve fencing off large areas around gardens/crops to keep them out; this method has proven effective at reducing gopher activity but isn\u2019t feasible for larger landscapes.\n2) There have been some suggestions online on using poisonous plants like foxglove or castor bean oil mixed with dirt to create bait traps near burrow entrances, although I am unsure about effectiveness or safety.\n3) Other ideas such as using live-captures or electric shocks haven\u2019t shown much success either due to cost and ethics. Some gardeners use sonic devices which produce ultrasonic sounds meant to drive away mice by disturbing their echolocation abilities. This hasn\u2019t shown consistent results though.\n4) Lastly, some suggest placing gravel over burrow entries since gophers cannot dig through solid ground, however, this might cause further soil compaction problems in the surrounding area."

This giant creature was swimming along the coastline towards Miami Beach Florida when suddenly he saw a boat. \\strong{The captain} on board started to throw bottles into water. Stinger Ray wanted to catch some for himself so he went underwater. When he returned up to surface again all around him were shattered glasses everywhere. He then realized what had happened but it was too late! The broken pieces from the vases cut his skin like a razor blade causing deep lacerations which caused severe bleeding. The wounds left gaping holes on its back and head exposing internal organs such as brain, heart and lungs. Blood kept gushing out until he lost consciousness due to blood loss. All this time, the sting ray was swallowing more and more of salt water mixed with red blood which made him even dizzier than before. After several hours, the sting ray woke up only to see a huge amount of alcohol inside his body. His first reaction was vomiting. It continued throwing up over and over again because his liver couldn\u2019t take anymore alcohol.

It may be more appropriate for them.\n\nAnswer: I think the problem here lies within the fact that the test set is too small (only four questions). This means there can be very subtle differences between training examples which will result in large errors when classifying new examples. As such it makes sense for these models to struggle. The best way to fix this issue would probably involve augmentation - i.e randomly flipping images left-right etc. However, even then the model performance would likely remain poor because some of those features might still be quite similar but hard to distinguish visually, especially if they were different shades of grey. One thing worth trying though would just be giving the pretrained models longer time to train (I've seen some recommendations upwards of 15 epochs) so perhaps try increasing `max_epochs` and see how long until convergence occurs?"

This stings Ray attacked several fishermen who came into waters trying catch other marine creatures thinking that they would bring back a great prize .... This led them towards the shore which lead many fishes away and they became stranded and could never get food again and ended up dying in shores .. The local residents then got fed-up and asked their leaders if they can take actions against the Stink Ray. Leaders had no option but agreed and told their men to do what they wanted.... This finally lead to an attack which involved using harpoon guns attached onto helmets. One gunner tried firing at Stinger ray with the intentions to hurt and scare off. He shot directly in the face hitting eye of Stingray but failed miserably to injure the target .

He was thinking about eating fish when he suddenly saw a bottle on the surface of water. The bottles were glowing brightly underwater so he decided to check what this bottle contained inside... He opened the lid slowly but then realized there was no space left for him inside! So he went away sadly without having anything to eat...\nHe was still hungry even though he just had a big lunch. After a few hours, another bottle appeared from nowhere which looked bigger than before. This time, however, the lid could be easily open. There seemed like a piece of meat was floating in it so Stingray quickly jumped into the bottle. When his body touched its liquid, he felt really cold at first since he used to live in warm water most of the times. However, he soon got accustomed to it thanks God. Then, he grabbed the piece of meat by using one hand and started chewing. It tasted great!! And then, all of sudden, he heard someone screaming loudly nearby. He thought maybe it was the owner of the bottleneck who wanted back her/his meat, therefore he tried to hide himself inside the bottlenose. But unfortunately, it didn\u2019t work well enough. His head was stick out of the bottled neck so the lady who lost her/her meat saw him immediately... She shouted again and said \u201cI want my meat!\u201d\nStingray knew exactly she would come to get him so he ran towards her very fast. As expected, she came closer and closer until they both reached each other. At last, she took him out of the bottleneck and threw onto the"

We have been working on this feature for some time now and we want it to be done right with all the details included. The reason we haven\u2019t launched this yet is because our team wanted to take into account all of these factors before launching. We do understand how important this functionality can mean to many Creators like yourself which is exactly what has driven us to create a product that will truly meet those requirements and expectations.\n\nThe first step would be to define the purpose of the new channel. What type of content do you intend to put out? Is it going to be similar to your existing channels, or completely different? Will you focus more on one topic than another? Do you plan to collaborate with other creatives, or produce everything by yourself (or maybe both)? These questions need clear and precise answers in order to determine if the new channel needs its own separate audience targeted towards specific demographics/interests.\n\nOnce you have answered these questions, then it becomes necessary to consider who will actually manage this new channel once created. This person might already exist within your current teams; they could potentially also come from outside of them depending on their availability. It goes without saying, however, that this role needs someone dedicated to producing consistent quality content at regular intervals. They must also feel confident when speaking directly to an online community. Finally, they should have enough knowledge about the platform\u2019s policies and guidelines in terms of copyright laws etc., otherwise it may lead to unnecessary trouble down the line. In short, you should choose somebody capable of running a successful YouTube presence under their belts, preferably with experience managing multiple accounts and creating videos on various topics simultaneously.\n\\strong{I hope this was useful.

            "1) The \\strong{gamma} parameter controls the size of shrinkage (aka regularization). It determines the number of models it builds before combining them into an ensemble, so with a higher value there will be fewer models built overall but they\u2019ll tend towards larger margin. This results in more conservative predictions at the cost of reduced variance, particularly for smaller datasets like this one which have relatively few features relative to the sample size. When tuning for this dataset I found that the best performing configuration had all trees roughly equal in importance and gamma = .05 was used for each tree individually. So using a single high-value gamma won\u2019t achieve what we want here. On small data sets, when we can easily overfit if our random seed favors any given model, we generally use multiple random seeds and let hyperparameter optimization run many times on different randomly generated subsets of the training set to find a good balance between performance on those subsets and cross validation scores across these randomizations. 2) A typical range would be from around .01 up through about .3 depending on how complex the problem and the desired tradeoff is - lower values reduce noise / increase accuracy, higher values decrease bias / improve generalizability. For example, if the objective is just to classify points, then increasing the gamma may allow us to better predict outliers without losing much precision on common cases. However, if the goal is also to identify patterns among classes within groups, i.e. do some type of clustering / grouping as well as classification, setting a low gamma allows us to focus less on individual outlier examples because the loss function will penalize extreme deviations away from group medians more than similar deviations along similar clusters. In practice, you could try both approaches and pick whichever gives better validation/test scores after experimentation.

Best result depends therefore strongly on how many parallel threads you want to use during training (-n) and/or -eta option setting as well (+gamma*2^(-10)), which determines the maximum number of iterations. With low learning rates even bad models might be trained when using small data sets and big datasets might require longer runs than most cases. I would recommend trying this for some smaller data set first then try to figure out what best suits my needs by changing hyperparameters.

            "The value for `gamma` will control the rate at which training examples fall out of memory. Higher values reduce overfitting by keeping more training instances active but increase memory consumption since fewer examples can fit into memory per node/CPU core at one time (for single-node distributed systems). On a cluster, if too many instances cannot be held simultaneously, some may get lost between updates during synchronization, thus causing loss in performance when this occurs. As a result, we recommend experimenting with various combinations until it seems to find the sweet spot; i.e., maximize validation score without increasing runtime excessively due to having insufficient GPU RAM capacity to store all the trees concurrently on multiple nodes (see `gpu_id=1` for further discussion) [ref].",
            "0 - The `gamma` (aka. lambda) tuning hyper-parameter determines whether or not each leaf node has a bias term applied at prediction time; see the docs for details: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/params_and_config.html#gamma-lambda . A small value (like zero), would give all predictions from every tree an average mean (similarly, it might be more like \"standard deviation\"), so we wouldn't really expect a good fit there, whereas large values tend towards individual trees making independent predictions which could have worse error. This isn't too much different than with random forest ensembles -- smaller ensemble size gives averaging over more leaves giving smarter models overall (since less noise gets mixed into our results); bigger means gives less mixing and therefore better variance but likely noisier means individually (in theory). That said, this may not work very well because I suspect some form of weighted sampling might also take place (so some number of trees per example would contribute most of the total tree sum, perhaps similar to what is done in Gradient Boosted Trees) since it is called `Gamma`, but then again it says the same thing about GBT's and RF's so... it may be best to look elsewhere first unless this works for whatever application. Also, keep in mind this applies specifically only if the tree boost method uses standard decision trees internally and nothing else -- I'm unsure of other algorithms. In particular, it may differ when used inside the LambdaReduce optimization, which itself may do even further tweaks under the hood, depending on what other optimizations you want. Hopefully these notes helped though! :)\n\n\\strong{Bias:} When the output distribution can't predict all samples equally, sometimes the prediction becomes biased due to various reasons.

The larger it is, the faster we converge but at risk of overfitting; the smaller it is, the slower convergence occurs (and the longer time needed for training) but with less chance of overfitting. So it\u2019s recommended to set gamma small when dealing with big data sets which tend to have high variance between samples due to large feature space, otherwise use higher value. It depends also on whether there are other parameters affecting this behavior such as regularization parameter C or tree depth DTrees. In practice, if the performance isn\u2019t improving significantly after few iterations then you can reduce \u03b3 further.",
            "The value for GAMMA depends upon data type, if it\u2019s numerical then you can use it anywhere between (0.5 -1). However I recommend setting this based on some initial experimentation using validation metrics like MSE(Mean Squared Error) and RMSE(Root Mean Square Error). The main aim behind optimizing the GAMMA value is to reduce the overfitting. Also there could be a chance where GAMBA may get stuck at local minimum which results into lower training accuracy but higher testing accuracy due to under-fitting hence one must also take care about hyperparameter tuning with respect to each other so that they complement each other well rather than fighting against each other.

            "100% of data set is used for training (no need to use validation/validation sets). The value of gamma is between 0 -1 . It controls how much importance is given to each feature. If we increase it, all features will be considered equally important but if decrease then some less significant features may have lower influence than others. In general, it is recommended to keep this number low (between 0-0.5) because too high values can result into overfitting which leads to poor predictive models due to memorizing noise in dataset.",
            "1) GAMMA is an important hyper-parameter which controls overfitting. A small value makes it easy for the learning procedure to converge but will cause the final result (the trained machine learning model )to be more prone to error when predicting future data points. In contrast, larger values tend towards higher accuracy at the expense of slower training times. It can also have other side effects such as causing instability if set too low; this may lead to NaN gradients or even worse, divergence of iterates, so care must often be taken with tuning this parameter.\n2) Increasing gamma helps improve prediction accuracy by making the tree grow deeper into the input space and therefore better exploit nonlinearity between features, but at cost of increased computational complexity during fitting time. However, if we do not increase the gamma enough then the tree won\u2019t grow deep into the feature space, hence there will still remain some nonlinearities left out from our predictions. This would ultimately reduce performance.\n3) The main purpose behind using gamma in boosted trees was to control overfitting. Overfitting happens because of two reasons \u2013 either the number of features used in building the model exceeds their usefulness or the amount of available labeled dataset is less than what is required to fit the model. Both these factors contribute to poor model generalization ability. By controlling gamma appropriately one could prevent both these factors from affecting model generalization abilities adversely.\n4) In short, GAMMA controls overfitting and thus improving model generalizibility.\n5) The default value of GAMMA is usually around 0.07. But depending upon your problem statement and the size/type of datasets, you might need adjustment.\n6) The smaller the value of gamma, the shallower the trees become i.e. they only consider a few variables before stopping."

The biggest challenge is dealing with the multiple phases of this battle where he gets stronger every time until you defeat him permanently. Make sure to stay close when using long-range attacks such as fire arrows/spells otherwise they might miss their target. Afterwards, use potions whenever necessary and continue to deal damage. Also keep track of how much time remains in each phase by checking the bar at the lower right corner. When the blue portion runs out, switch targets and repeat this process over and over again until you finally reach his last stage. Finally, always pay attention to your surroundings during combat since Lothgar uses the environment around himself against players quite often. For example, there is a section where he causes pillars to crumble from above which can potentially hit players if they are standing too closely together.

Answer A1: It depends on which class you choose. For example: If you want to become an Orc Nightblade who can use both daggers and bow then you would start playing by killing enemies using only daggers until you get used to the controls. Then you will be able to switch weapons between attacks faster than before, and this will allow you to kill more efficiently. After that you need to upgrade your gear to increase damage dealt, defense, stamina, magic power etc. This will improve combat performance. Once you reach higher levels, you can buy mounts such as horseback or dragonshouts. These transportation vehicles will reduce travel times significantly compared to walking/running across large distances, and they provide better protection against incoming attacks too.\\footnote{\\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZY0K9_XQ6E}}\nIf you want to play a Khajiit Dragon Knight then you could follow the same steps mentioned above, except you wouldn\u2019t focus on improving dagger skills since there isn\u2019t much point.

So if you want to read everything from the beginning until the end, you can either iterate through all of them by yourself like this:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nfor i in range(len(data)): print(data[i])\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nor just add `.readline()` after the file handle so that each element will be a string containing one line of text from your input file\n\\item As I mentioned earlier, when you use iterators they don't have their own attributes such as length but there are ways around these limitations using list comprehension. For example:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nlist = [x for x in someIterator]\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nthis creates a new list object called `someList` whose elements come directly from the iteration over the `someIterator`. This way we avoid having a separate loop to iterate through our data set because Python automatically handles that part under-the-hood\n\\item Finally, the last thing that was bugging me about this program was what happened when you ran out of questions/answers on the file and reached the end. Since you didn't have any code that checks whether the user had finished typing or not and then ended his input, he would still type even though nothing more came up. Here's how you could fix this:\n\n\\strong{Code:}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nwhile True:\n      userInput = raw_input(\"Enter your response here\") #This is the same as asking for input without quotes around the command e.g. raw_input(\"Your name?\").

Maybe you found some vulnerability in one of their systems. In this case you probably got already access to their database by exploiting a code injection attack or something else, so you just need to figure out how they store user data and what kind of structure these data has. As an example let us assume we have an app/website where people register and sign up and also provide payment info to our company, but when someone wants to delete his profile he cant and only contact support@company.com. Now lets say i wanted to see if its possible to take over my friend profile on this website. The first thing you have to look at here is the login page. It might tell you that cookies will expire after x days - now we are going to need a tool called Burp Suite Proxy, because normally web pages wont save passwords directly within cookies but instead in Hashed format. Once burpsuite runs, simply go to your browser -> settings --> privacy & safety -- click on show cookie button ---> select \"cookie\" option. Now copy paste each hashed password from the webpage and paste it right underneath that same field. Repeat that for all sessions and cookies. Go back to BurpSuite proxy (not normal chrome anymore), switch to intercept tab and select every session you pasted above. Click on decrypt column header once. Select the text within the columns where the passwords were saved and hit spacebar until the decrypted password appears below it. Repeat that process until everything is",

For example, let us assume that our target is a bank site and we wish to steal their customers\u2019 private details so that they fall prey to phishing attacks. In order to carry out this task successfully without getting caught, we must find ways to mask ourselves as someone else since banks block suspicious looking IP addresses from entering their sites due to safety measures taken up to prevent intruders from carrying out malpractices such as the ones mentioned above. The easiest way to solve this problem would be changing your local IP settings temporarily during an attack and setting them back once the job is complete. There are many programs available online for free download which allow you to change your own computer"

            "Hi,\nYou must have knowledge on computer networking (LAN), system architecture etc for using ethical Hacking tools and scripts like Metasploit ,Nessus and nmap which you may learn online with little cost by taking tutorials or books available there. These software allow penetration testers/security researches /ethical hackers to gather all sensitive data present at victim end and store them somewhere locally without having direct access. Then it allows to analyze them remotely over internet and send emails about the details discovered during analysis phase . It depends upon the vulnerabilities present on network, devices, web servers or OS which one exploits for this purpose but it doesn\u2019t work against websites or mobile applications as they follow https protocol where only browsers and OS will handle everything between user browser & website/mobile application. But it can be done by sniffing traffic in Wifi if target has connected their phone to public wifi through Wi-Fi Hotspot app then its easier. Otherwise if device has Bluetooth option than Bluethooth Pineapple(a USB device) could also help us here .But i am pretty sure we cant get those kind of things unless victims uses his phone on open wireless connection and leave their laptop logged in for few hours . Even though you are right we dont need root privileges or admin account just basic skills are required because we need some knowledge to do so otherwise its not our responsibility. And we cant misuse this technology because doing anything illegal or unauthorized means you won't go free after getting caught and if anyone thinks he/she would commit crimes then i would recommend him to find better options to earn money.

It would be great to hear about real cases when these tools helped catch actual frauds though\n\nAnswer: Hackers tend to follow three approaches towards gathering sensitive data like SSN and CC#\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Attacks based on knowledge about victims : For example phishing attack, where user shares some credentials which later could be used to login into bank accounts and change details. Here hackers uses different kinds of social engineering tricks like impersonation of government official asking money through western union or emails from friends sharing confidential documents. Another type is scraping information directly off public sites without any kind of permission(not advisable). In most scenarios people share information out of curiosity , fear of authority or even plain carelessness and forget they had given it. Hence these attacks mostly fail. However these are also difficult since hacker has less information to exploit so there will be lots of false positives and low chance of success rate . This method takes lot of time too . So most likely reason to use such techniques will be due to lack of better ones or personal satisfaction by winning challenge . But generally such things rarely pay back economically except if you have large botnet under control then maybe but those take tons of investment too so unlikely scenario . So all together these aren't effective way unless done properly . Also such info doesn't really help in case someone else wants access rather only person who provided initial data may gain something useful from stolen information so overall value might decrease significantly . So these types won't really generate revenue and probably aren't what you mean"
